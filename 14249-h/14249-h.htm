<p>"By all means, m'deah, let's go down between decks and have a look at
them."</p>

<p>"Of course, if you wish, Sir Charles, although--Do you think we shall be
edified, Mr. Gillett?"</p>

<p>"That depends, m'lady,"--and the speaker, a man with official manners
and ferret-like eyes, shifted from one foot to another,--"on what degree,
or particular class of criminal your ladyship would be interested in," he
added. "If in the ordinary category of skittle sharper or thimblerigger,"
with a suspicion of mild scorn, "then I do not imagine your ladyship <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[pg 2]</span>would find
much attraction in the present cargo. But, on the other hand," in a
livelier tone, "if your ladyship has any curiosity, or shall we say, a
psychological bent, regarding the real out-and-outer, the excursion should
be to your liking. For," rubbing his hands, "a properer lot of cutthroats
and bad magsmen, it has never been my privilege to escort across the
equator; and this is my sixth trip to Australia!"</p>

<p>"How interesting! How very interesting!" The lady's voice floated
languidly. "Sir Charles is quite right. We must really go down. At any
rate, it will be a change, after having been shut up so long in that
terrible state-room."</p>

<p>"One moment, m'lady! There's a little formality that must be observed
first."</p>

<p>"Formality?" And the lady, who was of portly appearance and uncertain
age, gazed from the speaker standing deferentially before her, to a man of
size, weight and importance seated in a comfortable chair at her side.
"What does he mean, Sir Charles?"</p>

<p>"Regulations, m'lady--m'lord!" was the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[pg 3]</span>answer. "No one allowed on the
prisoners' deck without the captain's permission. There he is now."</p>

<p>"Then be good enough to beckon to him!" said the lady.</p>

<p>But this Mr. Gillett, agent of the police, discreetly declined to do;
Captain Macpherson was a man not to be beckoned to by any one; much less by
him. As he stood squarely in the center of the ship, he looked like a
mariner capable of commanding his boat and all the people aboard; indeed,
some of the characteristics of his vessel seemed to have entered into his
own make-up; the man matched the craft. Broad-nosed, wide of beam, big,
massive, obstinate-looking, the <i>Lord Nelson</i> plowed aggressively
through the seas. With every square sail tugging hard at her sturdy masts,
she smote and over-rode the waves, and, beating them down, maintained an
unvarying, stubborn poise. But although she refused to vacillate or shuffle
to the wooing efforts of the uneasy waters, she progressed not without
noise and pother; foamed and fumed mightily at the bow and left behind her
a wake, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[pg
4]</span>receding almost as far as the eyes might reach. Captain Macpherson
looked after the bubbles, cast his glance aloft at the bulging patches of
white, and then condescended to observe the agent of the police who had
silently approached.</p>

<p>"Sir Charles and lady, and Sir Charles' party have expressed, Captain
Macpherson, the desire to obtain permission to visit the prisoners'
deck."</p>

<p>Captain Macpherson looked toward Sir Charles and his lady, the other
passengers lounging around them, a little girl, at the rail, her hair,
blown windward, a splash of gold against the blue sky. "What for?" said the
skipper bruskly.</p>

<p>"To have a look at the convicts, I suppose."</p>

<p>"What good'll that do them?" growled the commander. "Idle curiosity,
that's what I call it. Well, go along. Only, I'll hold you accountable, and
bear this in your mind, no tracts!"</p>

<p>"I don't think," replied Mr. Gillett with some asperity, "you need be
apprehensive on that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"
id="Page_5"></a>[pg 5]</span>score, Captain Macpherson. Sir Charles and
m'lady are not that sort."</p>

<p>"Well, keep them away from the bars. The weather has nae improved the
tempers of a few of the rapscallions, and they'd like naught better than a
chance for their claws."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the permission, and," a little stiffly, "the admonition,
which latter," turning away, "a man whose lifelong profession has been
dealing with convicts is most likely to stand in need of and heed."</p>

<p>Captain Macpherson frowned, stumped the other way, then looked once more
aloft, and, by the exercise of that ingenuity peculiarly his own, found new
tasks for the sailors. Aboard any ship, especially a ship of this
character, it was his theory and practice that discipline could not be too
strictly maintained and the men on the <i>Lord Nelson</i> knew no idle
moments.</p>

<p>"May I go, too?"</p>

<p>The child with the golden hair desisted in her occupation of watching
the flying-fish and other <i>real</i>-winged creatures, and, leaving the
rail, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[pg
6]</span>walked toward the group that was about to follow Mr. Gillett. She
was a very beautiful girl of ten or eleven; slim, delicately fashioned, of
a definite proud type. But although she held herself erect, in an
unconscious patrician sort of way, there was, also, about her something
wayward and different from the conventional, aristocratic set. The
disordered golden hair proclaimed it, while in the depths of the fine, blue
eyes manifold changing lights told of a capriciousness out of the pale of a
stiffly decorous and well-contained caste.</p>

<p>"May I go, too, aunt?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" interposed a blas&eacute;, cynical-appearing young man
who had just emerged from the cabin. "Don't know where she wants to go, or
what she wants to do; but don't say she can't; really you mustn't,
now."</p>

<p>"Well, since you insist on spoiling her, Lord Ronsdale--"</p>

<p>He twisted a blond mustache which adorned a handsome face that bore many
marks of what is called experience of the world. "Couldn't do that!
Besides, Jocelyn and I are great <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7"></a>[pg 7]</span>chums, don't you know. We're going to be
married some day when she grows up."</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> we?" said the child. "The man <i>I</i> marry must be very
big and strong, and must <i>not</i> have light hair."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale laughed tolerantly.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time for you to change your mind, don't you know. Meanwhile,
I'll not despair. Faint heart, and so on. But," turning to Sir Charles,
"where is it she 'wants to go?'"</p>

<p>"To see the convicts."</p>

<p>"Convicts? Ah!" He spoke rather more quickly than usual, with accent
sharper.</p>

<p>"You didn't know who your neighbors were going to be when you decided so
suddenly to accompany us?"</p>

<p>"No." His voice had a metallic sound.</p>

<p>Sir Charles addressed Mr. Gillett. "Tell us something more definite
about your charges whom we are going to inspect. Meant to have found out
earlier in the voyage, but been so jolly seasick, what with one gale after
another, I for one, until now, haven't much cared whether we had Claude
Duval and Dick Turpin themselves <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8"></a>[pg 8]</span>for neighbors, or whether we all went straight
to Davy Jones' locker together. A bad lot, you have already informed us!
But how bad?"</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't exactly M. Duval or Mr. Turpin in the pen, but we've
one or two others almost as celebrated in their way. There's Billy Burke,
as desperate a cracksman as the country can produce, with," complacently,
"a record second to none in his class. He"--and Mr. Gillett, with
considerable zest entered into the details of Mr. Burke's eventful and
rapacious career. "Then there's the ''Frisco Pet,' or the 'Pride of Golden
Gate,' as some of the sporting papers call him."</p>

<p>"The 'Frisco Pet!" Lord Ronsdale started; his color slightly changed;
his lashes drooped over his cold eyes. "He is on board this vessel?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you remember him, my Lord, I dare say?"</p>

<p>"In common with many others," shortly.</p>

<p>"Many of the gentry and titled classes did honor him with their
attention, I believe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[pg
9]</span>"Why," asked Jocelyn, whose blue eyes were fastened very intently
on the face of the police agent, "did they call him such a funny name, the
'Frisco Pet?"</p>

<p>"Because he's a yankee bruiser, prize-fighter, or was, before the drink
got him," explained Mr. Gillett. "And originally, I believe, he hailed from
the land of the free. Some one brought him to London, found out about his
'talents' and put him in training. He was a low, ignorant sailor; could
scarcely write his own name; but he had biceps and a thick head. Didn't
know when he was whipped. I can see him yet, as he used to look, with his
giant shoulders and his swagger as he stepped into the ring. There was no
nonsense about him--or his fist; could break a board with that. And how the
shouts used to go up; 'the pet!' 'a quid on the pet!' 'ten bob on the stars
and stripes!' meaning the costume he wore. Oh, he was a favorite in Camden
Town! But one night he failed them; met some friends from the forecastle of
a Yankee trader that had dropped down the Thames. Went into the ring with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[pg
10]</span>stagger added to the swagger. Well, they took him out
unconscious; never was a man worse punished. He never got back to the
sawdust, and the sporting gentlemen lost a bright and shining light."</p>

<p>"Broke his heart, I suppose," observed Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"How could that break his heart?" asked the child wonderingly. "I
thought when people had their hearts broken--"</p>

<p>"Jocelyn, don't interrupt!" said the wife of Sir Charles. "Although," to
her husband, in a lower tone, "I must confess these details a little
tiresome!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" Sir Charles' voice rose in lively protest. "I remember out
in Australia reading about the fellow in the sporting papers from home, and
wondering what had become of him. So that was it? Go on, Mr. Gillett! With
your permission, m'love!"</p>

<p>The police agent proceeded. "After that it was a case of the rum and the
toss-pots, and when he was three sheets in the wind, look out for squalls!
He got put in quad, broke out, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11"></a>[pg 11]</span>overpowered and nearly killed two guards.
Took to various means of livelihood, until they got him again. Trouble in
prison; transferred to the solitary with a little punishment thrown in for
a reminder. When he got out of limbo again, he lived in bad company, in one
of the tunnels near the Adelphi; hard place for the police to rout a cove
from. Then followed a series of rough bungling jobs he was supposed to have
been mixed up in. At any rate, he got the credit. More hazards than loot!
He had too heavy fingers for anything fine; but he made it quite
interesting for the police, quite interesting! So much so, he attracted
<i>me</i>, and I concluded to take a hand, to direct the campaign against
him, as it were."</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett paused; obviously in his case egotism allied to enthusiasm
made his duties a pleasure; he seemed now briefly commending himself in his
own mind. "Up to this time," he resumed, "our friend, the ex-pugilist, had
never actually killed any one, but soon after I engaged myself to look
after him, word was brought to the department that a poor woman <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[pg 12]</span>had been
murdered, a cheap music-hall dancer. She had seen better days,
however."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale, who had been looking away, yawned, as if finding the
police agent "wordy," then strolled to the rail.</p>

<p>"Suspicion pointed strongly in his direction; and we got him after a
struggle. It was a hard fight, without a referee, and maybe we used him a
little rough, but we had to. Then Dandy Joe was brought in. Joe's a plain,
mean little gambler and race-track follower, with courage not big enough
for broad operations. But he had a wide knowledge of what we term the
thieves' catacombs, and, well, he 'peached' on the big fellow. Gave
testimony that was of great service to the prosecution. The case seemed
clear enough; there was some sort of contrary evidence put in, but it
didn't amount to anything. His record was against him and he got a heavy
sentence, with death as a penalty, if he ever sets foot in England
again."</p>

<p>"What," asked Mr. Gillett's youngest listener, "is 'peached'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[pg
13]</span>"In school-girl parlance, it is, I believe, to 'tell on' some
one."</p>

<p>"You mean a tattle-tale?" scornfully. "I hate them."</p>

<p>"They have their uses," he answered softly. "And I'm rather partial to
them, myself. But if you are ready, m'lord--m'lady--"</p>

<p>"Quite! Egad! I'm curious to have a look at the fellow. Used to like to
see a good honest set-to myself occasionally, before I
became--ahem!--governor!" And rising with alacrity, Sir Charles assisted
his lady from her chair. "Coming, Ronsdale?"</p>

<p>"Believe I won't go down," drawled the nobleman at the rail. "Air better
up here," he explained.</p>

<p>Sir Charles laughed, got together the other members of his party and all
followed Mr. Gillett to a narrow companion way. There a strong iron door
stopped their progress, but, taking a key from his pocket the police agent
thrust it into a great padlock, gave it a turn, and swung back the barrier.
Before them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[pg
14]</span>stretched a long aisle; at each end stood a soldier, with musket;
on one side were the cells, small, heavily-barred. The closeness of the air
was particularly and disagreeably noticeable; here sunlight never entered,
and the sullen beating of the waves against the wooden shell was the only
sound that disturbed the tomb-like stillness of the place.</p>

<p>One or two of the party looked soberer; the child's eyes were large with
awe and wonder; she regarded, not without dread, something moving, a shape,
a human form in each terrible little coop. But Mr. Gillett's face shone
with livelier emotions; he peered into the cells at his charges with a keen
bright gaze that had in it something of the animal tamer's zest for his
part.</p>

<p>"Well, how are we all to-day?" he observed in his most animated manner
to the guard. "All doing well?"</p>

<p>"Number Six complained of being ill, but I say it's only the dumps.
Number Fourteen's been garrulous."</p>

<p>"Garrulous, eh? Not a little flighty?" <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[pg 15]</span>The guard nodded; Mr. Gillett
whispered a few instructions, asked a number of other questions. Meanwhile
the child had paused before one of the cells and, fascinated, was gazing
within. What was it that held her? the pity of the spectacle? the terror of
it? Her blue eyes continued to rest on the convict, a young fellow of no
more than one-and-twenty, of magnificent proportions, but with face sodden
and brutish. For his part he looked at her, open-mouthed, with an
expression of stupid surprise at the sight of the figure so daintily and
slenderly fashioned, at the tangles of bright golden hair that seemed to
have imprisoned some of the sunshine from above.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" he muttered hoarsely. "Where'd you come from? Looks
like one o' them bally Christmas dolls had dropped offen some counter in
Fleet Street and got in here by mistake!"</p>

<p>A mist sprang to the blue eyes; she held her white, pretty fingers tight
against her breast. "It must be terrible--here"--she said falteringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[pg
16]</span>The convict laughed harshly. "Hell!" he said laconically.</p>

<p>The child trembled. "I'm sorry," she managed to say.</p>

<p>The fierce dark eyes stared at her. "What for?"</p>

<p>"Because--you have to stay here--"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm--" But this time he apparently found no adequate adjective.
"If this ain't the rummiest Christmas doll!"</p>

<p>She put out her hand. "Here's something for you, poor man," she said, as
steadily as she could. "It's my King George gold piece, date 1762, and
belonged to my father who wore it on his watch chain and who is dead.
Perhaps they'll let you buy something with it."</p>

<p>He looked at the hand. "If she ain't stickin' out her duke to me, right
through the bars. Blamed if she ain't! Looks like a lily! A bally white
lily!" he repeated wonderingly. "One of them kind we wonst run acrost when
the Cap. turned us adrift on an island, jest to waller in green grass!"</p>

<p>"Don't you want it?" said the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[pg
17]</span>He extended a great, coarse hand hesitatingly, as if half-minded
to and half-minded not to touch the white finger-tips.</p>

<p>"You ain't afraid?"</p>

<p>The golden head shook ever so slightly; again the big hand went toward
the small one, then suddenly dropped.</p>

<p>"Right this way m'lord--m'lady!" The face of the convict abruptly
changed; fury, hatred, a blind instinct to kill were unmistakably revealed
in his countenance as he heard the bland voice of the police agent. From
the child's hand the gold disk fell and rolled under the wooden slab that
served as a couch in the cell.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn!" The expostulating tones of the governor's wife preceded the
approach of the party. "What are you doing, child, so near the bars?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Mr. Gillett seized the girl's arm and abruptly drew her
away. "My dear little lady!" he said. "Really you don't know the danger you
run. And near that cell of all of them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[pg
18]</span>"That cell?" observed Sir Charles. "Then that is--"</p>

<p>"The convict I was telling you about! The 'Pet of 'Frisco.' The 'Pride
of Golden Gate.'"</p>

<h3><a name='A_MESSAGE_TO_THE_ADMIRALTY'></a>A MESSAGE TO THE
ADMIRALTY</h3>


<p>The following night, Captain Macpherson in his cabin, rolled up
carefully the chart he had been scanning, deposited it in a copper cylinder
and drew from his pocket a small pipe. As he filled and lighted it,
exhaling the smoke of the black weed and leaning more comfortably back in
his low, swinging chair, the expression of his iron countenance exhibited,
in the slightest degree, that solace which comes from the nicotine.
Occasionally, however, he would hold his pipe away from his mouth, to pause
and listen. The weather had turned nasty again; above, the wind sounded
loudly. Now it descended on the ship like a fierce-scolding virago, then
rushed on with wild, shrieking dissonance. The <i>Lord Nelson</i> minded
not, but continued steadily on her way.</p>

<p>Her captain emptied his pipe, glanced toward <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[pg 20]</span>his bunk and started to take
off his coat. Human nature has its limit; he had passed many sleepless
nights and now felt entitled to a brief respite, especially as the chart
showed neither reef nor rock anywhere in the neighborhood. But he had only
one arm out of the garment when something happened that caused him to
change his mind; abruptly hurled to the other end of the cabin, he found
himself lying, half-stunned, on the floor. A hubbub of noises filled the
air, snappings, crashings, the rending of woodwork.</p>

<p>Captain Macpherson staggered to his feet, and, swaying like a drunken
man, stood a few moments holding his hand to his brow. Then his fist
clenched and he shook it at the cylinder that had fallen from the
table.</p>

<p>"Ye viperous, lying thing!" he cried, and ran from the cabin to the
deck.</p>

<p>A single glance told all: two of the ship's giant spars had gone by the
board; entangled in her own wreckage, the vessel thumped and pounded with
ominous violence against some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21"></a>[pg 21]</span>sunken reef. The full scope of the plight of
the once noble ship was plainly made manifest. Though thick streams of scud
sped across the sky, the southern moon at the moment looked down between
two dark rivulets, and cast its silvery glow like a lime-light, over the
spectacle. Captain Macpherson groaned.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Brien!" he called loudly.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"How long do you give her?"</p>

<p>"Half an hour, sir."</p>

<p>The master shook his head. "She'll nae last that long." And holding to a
stanchion, he seemed like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>"Any orders, sir?" asked the chief mate.</p>

<p>Captain Macpherson recovered himself; his tone became once more quick
and incisive. "Ye're right; I'm gone daffy. We'll get this business over in
a decorous and decent manner. And, Mr. O'Brien--lest I have nae time to
speak of it later--should ye get ashore, and ever find yourself in the
neighborhood o' Piccadilly, be so gude as to drop into the admiralty <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[pg 22]</span>office and
say Captain Macpherson sends his compliments, and--to the diel with their
charts!"</p>

<p>"I'll not forget, sir!" A number of orders followed.</p>

<p>As the chief mate disappeared to execute the commands he had received,
the harsh noises of the breaking ship, the seething of the sea about her,
the flapping of canvas, like helpless broken wings, was supplemented by a
babel of new and terrifying sounds, the screaming and cursing of the
convicts below, their blasphemous shrieking to be let out! To this turmoil
and uproar were added the frantic appeals and inquiries of the passengers
who, more or less dressed, had hurried to the deck and who were now
speaking to the master of the ill-starred vessel. He answered them briefly:
what could be done, would be done.</p>

<p>"It's a question of the boats, I suppose?" Sir Charles, one of the
calmest of the ship's cabin party, asked quickly.</p>

<p>"In ten minutes they'll be ready for the launching with nae lack of
water and provision. Get plenty of wraps and greatcoats. It'll be <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[pg 23]</span>a bit
disagreeable, nae doubt, out yon in the wee craft!"</p>

<p>"Wee craft!" The voice of the governor's lady--she was clinging to her
husband's arm--rose shrilly. "You surely are not going to send us out there
in one of these miserable cockleshells?"</p>

<p>"M'love!" Sir Charles expostulated mildly drawing her closer as he
spoke, "it's the only chance, and--" Then to the captain
half-apologetically--"She'll meet it with me, as she has met danger before,
in the bush, like a true English-woman! But what," indicating the convicts'
deck, "what about them? It seems inhuman, yet if they were let out--"</p>

<p>"They must not be!" Lord Ronsdale's metallic voice interposed quickly.
"I call upon you, Captain Macpherson, in the name of the women and
children--"</p>

<p>"I've thought about that," said Captain Macpherson shortly, and turned
to his task.</p>

<p>The boat was soon overhauled, the lockers and water-butt were filled,
and the passengers, one by one, set into it. On the whole, at that moment
for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[pg
24]</span>leaving the ship, their conduct left little room for criticism;
one or two of the women who had appeared on the verge of hysterics now
restrained audible manifestation of emotion. Sir Charles proved a monument
of helpfulness; assisted in placing the women here and there, and extended
a helpful hand to Lord Ronsdale, who had become somewhat dazed and inert.
Total darkness added to the difficulties of their task, for the moon which
until then had shone with much luster now went behind a curtain of cloud.
But Captain Macpherson coolly called out by name the men to handle the
life-boat, and, with no evidence of disorder, they crowded in, none too
soon! As the boat with its human freight hung in readiness for the
lowering, the remaining spar of the <i>Lord Nelson</i> fell with a mighty
crash.</p>

<p>"Remember the name of your ship, lads!" Captain Macpherson's voice
seemed to anticipate a movement of panic among the seamen on deck; if there
had been any intention to "rush" the already well-loaded boat, it was
stayed. "Mr. Gillett, I'll be troubling ye for the keys <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[pg 25]</span>to the
convicts' deck. Mr. O'Brien, get in and take charge. Steer southeast with a
bit of rag; it's your best chance to get picked up. Hold near the ship
until the other boat with the crew can come alongside. It's as well to keep
company. Are the lines clear? Let her go."</p>

<p>The boat was lowered and at the right moment touched a receding wave.
Captain Macpherson waited until the chief officer called out that they were
safely away, then gave his last order:</p>

<p>"And now, lads, ye can be lookin' to yourselves!"</p>

<p>They did; the master turned and with some difficulty made his way toward
the convicts' cells. Her decks soon deserted, the ship, like a living,
writhing thing, seemed to struggle and groan, as if every timber were
crying out in vain protest against the tragic consummation. But only an
irrevocable voice answered, that of the mocking sea beating harder, the
cruel sea, spotted here and there with black patches between which splashes
of light revealed the wild waves throwing high their curd in the cold,
argent glimmer. One of these illuminating <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[pg 26]</span>dashes, as if in a spirit of
irony, moved toward the ship, almost enveloped it and showed suddenly a
number of mad, leaping human figures issuing with horrible cries from one
of the hatches.</p>

<p>"The life rafts! Old man said the boats were gone."</p>

<p>"Rafts good enough for the likes of us, eh? Well, he's paid for keeping
us down so long. Blime if I don't think Slick Sam killed him."</p>

<p>"The rafts!" Shrieking, calling down maledictions on the captain, they
ran about, when suddenly an angry black wave swept the deck; a few went
overboard with the hissing crest; several were hurled against the bulwarks,
limp, lifeless things, swirled back and forth. One of their number, a big
fellow of unusual strength, was shot toward the open companionway leading
to the main cabin; as he plunged down, he clutched at and caught the
railing. Considerably shaken, dripping with water, he pulled himself
together, and, raising a face, sodden and fierce, like a beast brought to
bay, he looked around him. The light of one or two swinging <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[pg 27]</span>lamps that
had not yet been shattered revealed dimly the surroundings, the dark
leather upholstering, the little tables. Uncertainly the convict paused;
then suddenly his eyes brightened; the lustful anticipation of the drunkard
who had long been denied shone from his gaze as it rested on a sideboard
across the cabin.</p>

<p>"Bottles!" he said, steadying himself. "Rum! Well, I guess there ain't
much chance for any of us, and a man's a fool to go to hell thirsty!" He
had started toward the sideboard with its bright gleaming ware and its
divers and sundry receptacles of spirits and liqueurs, when suddenly his
look changed, and his jaw fell.</p>

<p>"What the--" A flow of choice Billingsgate, mingled with the sailor's
equally eloquent Golden-Gate, completed the sentence. The convict stood
stock-still.</p>

<p>From the door of a state-room at the far end of the cabin a figure
appeared. A great shawl draped the small form; the golden hair, a flurry of
tangles, floated around it. Clinging to a brass rail that ran along the
side of the cabin, she approached, her eyes all alight as if well <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[pg 28]</span>satisfied
with something. Amazed beyond power of action, the man continued to gaze at
her, at the tiny feet in the little pink slippers, at something she
carried. "By the great horn spoon, the Christmas doll!" he muttered
hoarsely. Then forgetting his purpose, the bottles, he lurched quickly
toward her.</p>

<p>"Wat you doin' here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I slipped out," said the child, holding the rail tighter, as perforce
she paused to answer. "I thought it would take only a moment."</p>

<p>"Slipped out?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Of the life-boat, I mean. It was dark and they didn't see me. I just
happened to think, and I had to do it. If I'd told them, they mightn't have
let me. It would have been very wicked if I'd gone away and
forgotten--don't you think so? And now I'm going back! Only I am afraid
I've been longer than I thought I would be. The door of my state-room
seemed to stick, and I was a few minutes getting it open."</p>

<p>Beneath disheveled masses of thick dark hair, the brutish face continued
to study the fairylike <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29"></a>[pg 29]</span>one; for the instant words seemed to fail
him. "Do ye mean," he observed, "you come back here for that measly
dicky-bird?"</p>

<p>"It isn't 'measly' and it isn't a 'dicky-bird!'" she answered
indignantly. "And I'll thank you not to call it that. It's a love-bird, and
its name is Dearie!"</p>

<p>"'Dearie'! Ho! Ho!" The ship reeled at a dangerous angle, but the
convict appeared not to notice; his voice rose in harsh, irresistible rough
merriment. "'Dearie'! And she thanks me not to call it names! It! No
bigger'n my thumb! Ho! Ho!" His laughter, strange at such a moment, died
abruptly. "Do you know what you've gone and done on account of what's in
that cage?" he demanded almost fiercely. "You've got left!"</p>

<p>"Left?" said she blankly, shrinking from him a little. "You don't
mean--oh, I thought I would be only a minute! They haven't really gone,
and--"</p>

<p>The great fingers closed on her arm. "They've gone and the crew's gone!
Both boats are gone!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[pg
30]</span>"Oh!" The big blue eyes widened on him; an inkling of her plight
seemed to come over her; her lips trembled, but she held herself bravely.
"You mean--we must drown?"</p>

<p>The thunder of seas breaking on the deck answered; a cascade of water
dashed down the companionway and swept round them. The man bent toward the
child. "Look a' that! Now ain't ye sorry ye come back?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't leave it to drown!" passionately--"couldn't!--couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Blow me, she's game!" With difficulty he maintained his equilibrium.
"See here: maybe there's a chance, if any of them's left to help with the
raft. But we've got to git out o' this!"</p>

<p>He passed his hand through her arm, awaited a favorable moment, and
then, making a dash for the stairs, drew her, as best he might, to the
deck. At the head of the companionway, the wind smote them fiercely with
sheets of foam, but his strength stood him in good stead, and bracing
himself hard, the man managed to maintain his stand; holding the child
close to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[pg
31]</span>him, he sheltered her somewhat from the full force of the storm.
As he cast his glance over the deck, an oath burst from his lips; the
convicts had succeeded in launching one of the rafts and leaving the ship
by means of it, or else had been carried away by the seas. Of living man,
he caught no sight; only a single one of the dead yet remained, sliding
about on the slippery planks with the movement of the ship; now to leeward,
now rushing in a contrary direction, as if some grotesque spirit of life
yet animated the dark, shapeless form.</p>

<p>From wave-washed decks the man's glance turned to the sea; suddenly he
started; his eyes straining, he stared hard. "Maybe they've missed you. One
of the ship's boats seems headin' this way!"</p>

<p>Her gaze followed his; at intervals through driving spray a small craft
could be discerned, not far distant, now riding high on a crest, now
vanishing in a black furrow.</p>

<p>"Are they coming back to save us?" asked the child.</p>

<p>The convict did not answer. Could the boat <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[pg 32]</span>make the ship, could it hope
to, in that sea? It was easier getting away than getting back. Besides, the
opportunity for a desperate, heroic attempt to come alongside was not to be
given her, for scarcely had they caught sight of her, when the stern of the
<i>Lord Nelson</i>, now filled with water from the inflow at the bow, began
to settle more rapidly. Then came a frightful wrenching and the vessel
seemed to break in two.</p>

<p>"Put yer arms round my neck," said the man, stooping.</p>

<p>She put one of them around; with the other held up the cage. He opened
the door of the wickerwork prison and a tiny thing flew out. Then he
straightened. Both arms were around him now.</p>

<p>"'Fraid?" he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>The child shook her head.</p>

<p>An instant he waited, then launched himself forward. Buffeted hither and
thither, he made a fierce fight for the rail, reached it, and leaped far
out into the seething waters.</p>

<h3><a name='AN_UNAPPRECIATED_BOUNTY'></a>AN UNAPPRECIATED BOUNTY</h3>


<p>In the prime of his belligerent career the Pet of 'Frisco had undergone
many fierce contests and withstood some terrible punishments, but never had
he undertaken a task calling for greater courage and power of endurance
than the one he had this night voluntarily assumed. Dashed about by the
seas, he yet managed to keep to the surface; minutes seemed to lengthen
into eternity; many times he called out loudly. The arms about his neck
relaxed, but he held the child to him. Not for an instant did the
temptation come to him to release her that he might the more surely save
himself. Overwhelmed again and again by the waves, each time he emerged
with her tight against his breast; half-strangled, he continued to fight
on. But at length even his dogged obstinacy and determination began to
flag; he felt <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[pg
34]</span>his strength going, when raising his eyes he saw one of the small
craft from the lost vessel bearing directly down upon him.</p>

<p>The sight inspired new energy and effort; nearer, nearer, she drew; now
she was but a few yards away. Then suddenly the sheet of the life-boat went
out and the little sail fluttered like a mad thing, while the men bent with
might and main over their ash handles in the endeavor to obey the commands
of the chief mate in the stern. But despite skill and strength she was not
easy to steer; once she nearly capsized; then eager hands reached over the
side. The convict held up the child; a voice--the police agent's--called
out that they "had her"; and then the mate broke in with harsh, warning
yells.</p>

<p>"Pull port!--quick!--or we're over!" And at once the outreaching arms
returned quickly to their task; as the child was drawn in, oars dragged and
tugged; the life-boat came slowly about, shipping several barrels of water.
At the same time some one made the loosened sheet taut, the canvas caught
the gust and the craft gained sufficient headway to enable her <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[pg 35]</span>to run
over, and not be run down by the seas. As she careened and plunged, racing
down a frothing dark billow, the convict, relieved of his burden, clung to
the lower gunwale. By a desperate effort he drew himself up, when a face
vaguely remembered--as part of a bad dream--looked into his, with a dash of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Eh?--Gimme a hand--"</p>

<p>The asked-for hand swept suddenly under the one grasping the side of the
boat, and shot up sharply. In the darkness and confusion no one saw the
act. The convict disappeared, but his half-articulate curses followed.</p>

<p>"The fellow's let go," muttered Lord Ronsdale with a shiver.</p>

<p>At the steering oar the chief mate, hearing the cries of the man, cast a
swift glance over his shoulder and hesitated. To bring the boat,
half-filled with water, around now, meant inevitable disaster; one
experiment of the sort had well-nigh ended in their all being drowned. He
knew he was personally responsible for the lives in his charge; and with
but an instant in which to decide, he declined to repeat the risk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[pg
36]</span>"He's probably gone by this time, anyhow," he told himself, and
drove on.</p>

<p>The convict, however, was not yet quite "gone"; as the boat receded
rapidly from view, becoming smaller and smaller, he continued mechanically
to use his arms. But he had as little heart as little strength to go on
with the uneven contest.</p>

<p>"He's done me! done me!" he repeated to himself. "And I ain't never
goin' to git a chance to fix him," he thought, and looked despairingly at
the sky. The dark rushing clouds looked like black demons; the stars they
uncovered were bright gleaming dagger points. "Ain't never!--the slob!" And
with a flood of almost sobbing invective he let himself go.</p>

<p>But as the waters closed over him and he sank, his hand, reaching
blindly out to grip in imagination the foe, touched something round--like a
serpent, or an eel. His fingers closed about it--it proved to be a line; he
drew himself along, and to his surprise found himself again on the surface,
and near a great fragment of wreckage. This he might have discovered <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[pg 37]</span>earlier,
but for the anger and hatred that had blinded him to all save the
realization of his inability to wreak vengeance. Now, though he managed to
reach the edge of the swaying mass from which the line dangled, he was too
weak to draw himself up on the floating timbers. But he did pass a loop
beneath his arms, and, thus sustained, he waited for his strength to
return. Finally, his mind in a daze, the convict clambered, after repeated
efforts, upon the wreckage, fastened the line about him again, and, falling
into a saucer-like hollow, he sank into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The night wore on; he did not move. The sea began to subside; still he
lay as if dead. Dawn's rosy lips kissed away the black shadows, touched
tenderly the waves' tops, and at length the man stirred. He tried to sit
up, but at first could not. Finally he raised himself and looked about
him.</p>

<p>No other sign of the vessel than that part of it which had served him so
well could he see; this fragment seemed rent from the bow; yes, there was
the yellow wooden mermaid bobbing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38"></a>[pg 38]</span>to the waves; but not as of old! Poor
cast-out trollop,--now the seas made sport of her who once had held her
head so high!</p>

<p>The convict continued to gaze out over the ocean. Far away, a dark
fringe broke the sea-line--a suggestion of foliage--an island, or a mirage?
Tantalizing, it lay like a shadow, illusive, unattainable as the "forgotten
isles." The man staggered to his feet; his garments were torn; his hair
hung over his brow. He shook his arms at the island;--this phantasy, this
vain, empty vision, he regarded it now as some savage creature might a bone
just out of its reach; from his lips vile words fell--to be suddenly
hushed. Between him and what he gazed at, along the range of vision, an
object on one of the projecting timbers caught his eye. It was very small,
but it gleamed like a spark sprung from the embers of the dawn.</p>

<p>"The dicky-bird!" His dried lips tried to laugh. "Ef it ain't the
dicky-bird!" The bird looked at him. "Ef that doesn't beat--" but he could
not think what it "beat." The bird cocked its head. "Ain't ye afeard o'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[pg 39]</span>me?"
It gave a feeble chirp. "Well, I'm damned!" said the man, and after this
mild expression of his feelings, forgot to curse again. He even began to
eye the island with a vague questioning wonder, as if asking himself what
means might be thought of that would enable him to reach it; but the
problem seemed to be beyond solution. The wreckage, like a great lump, lay
supinely on the surface of the water; he could not hope to move it.</p>

<p>The day slowly passed; the sun dried his clothes; once or twice the bird
made a sound--a plaintive little tone--and involuntarily the man moved with
care, thinking not to frighten it. But caution in that regard seemed
unnecessary, for the bird appeared very tame and not at all averse to
company.</p>

<p>Toward noon the man began to suffer more acutely from thirst, and
drawing out a sailors' oilskin pouch, one of the few possessions he had
been allowed by the police to retain, he took from it a piece of tobacco
which he began to chew. At the same time he eyed the rest of the
contents--half a ship's biscuit, some matches <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[pg 40]</span>and a mariner's thimble. The
biscuit he broke, and threw a few crumbs, where the timbers were dry, near
the bird. For a long time it looked at the tiny white morsels; but finally,
conquering shyness, hopped from its perch and tentatively approached the
banquet. Hours went by; the man chewed; the bird pecked.</p>

<p>That night it rained in real, tropical earnest, and he made a water
vessel of his shoe, drank many times, ate a few mouthfuls of biscuit, and
then placed the filled receptacle where he had thrown the crumbs. As he did
so he found himself wondering if the dawn would reveal his little feathered
shipmate or whether it had been swept away by the violence of the rain. The
early shafts of day showed him the bird on its perch; it had apparently
found shelter from the heavy down-pour beneath some out-jutting timber and
seemed no worse for the experience. The man's second glance was in the
direction of the island; what he saw brought a sudden exclamation to his
lips. The land certainly seemed much nearer; some current was sweeping them
toward it slowly, but irresistibly. The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[pg 41]</span>'Frisco Pet swore joyfully;
his eyes shone. "I may do him yet!" he muttered. The bird chirped; he
looked at it. "Breakfast, eh?" he said and tossed a few more crumbs near
the shoe.</p>

<p>The second day on the floating bow, he brooded a great deal; the sharper
pangs of hunger assailed him; he grew desperately impatient, the distance
to the island decreased so gradually. A breeze from the coveted shore
fanned his cheek; he fancied it held them back, and fulminated against
it,--the beneficent current,--the providential timbers! A feeling of blind
helplessness followed; the sun, beating down fiercely, made him
light-headed. Hardly knowing what he did, he drew forth the last little bit
of the biscuit, ground it between his teeth and greedily swallowed it. The
act seemed to sober him; he raised his big hand to his brow and looked at
"Dearie"; through the confusion of his thoughts he felt he had done some
despicable thing.</p>

<p>"That weren't fair play, were it now?" he said, looking at the bird.
"That ain't like a pal," he repeated. The bird remained silent; he <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[pg 42]</span>fancied
reproach in its bead-like eyes, they seemed to bore into him. "And you such
a small chap, too!" he muttered; then he turned his back on the island,
and, with head resting on his elbow, uttered no further complaint.</p>

<p>That second day on the raft seemed much longer than the first; the
second night of infinitely greater duration than the preceding one; but
dawn revealed the island very near, so near, indeed, the bird made up its
mind to try to reach it. It looked at the man for a moment and then flew
away. Long he watched it, a little dark spot--now that he could no longer
see the ruby on its breast! At length it was lost to sight; swallowed up by
the green blur.</p>

<p>The small winged creature gone, the man missed it. "'Peared like 'twas
glad to leave such a pal!" he thought regretfully. The floating timbers
became well-nigh intolerable; he kept asking himself if he could swim to
land, but, knowing his weakness from long fasting, he curbed his
impatience. His eyes grew tired with staring at the longed-for spot; he
suffered the torments of Tantalus, and finally could endure <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[pg 43]</span>them no
longer. So making his clothes into a bundle, he tied them around his neck
and slipped into the water.</p>

<p>Half an hour later found him, prone and exhausted, on the yellow sands.
Near-by, tall and stately trees nodded at him; close at hand a great crab
regarded him with reflective interest, hesitating between prudence and
carnivorous desire. Gluttonous inclination to sample the goods the gods had
provided prevailed over caution; it moved quickly forward, when what it had
considered only an unexpected and welcome <i>pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance</i> abruptly got up. The tables were turned; that which
came to dine was dined upon; a crushing blow demonstrated the law of the
survival of the fittest; the weaker adorned the board. The man tore it to
bits, ate it like the famished animal he was. More freely his blood
coursed; he looked around; saw other creatures and laughed. There seemed
little occasion for any one to starve here; the isle, a beautiful emerald
on the breast of the sea, became a fair battle-ground; all he needed was a
club and he soon found that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[pg
44]</span>For a week nothing of moment interrupted the even tenor of his
existence; he led the life of a savage and found it to his liking, pounced
upon turtles and cooked them, kept his fire going because he had but few
matches. Lying before the blaze at night, near a little spring, he told
himself that this was better than being behind prison bars; true, he lacked
company, but he had known worse solitude--the "solitary." In it, he had
lain on the hard stones; here he had soft moss. If only he could reach out
and touch those he hated--the unknown enemy whose face had bent over him a
fleeting instant ere he had struck his hand from the gunwale; Dandy Joe and
the police agent--if only they, too, were here, the place would have been
world enough for him. But then, he felt, the time for the reckoning must
come,--it lay somewhere in the certain future. Unconscious fatalist, he
nourished the conviction as he nourished the coals of his fire.</p>

<p>Other means to enhance his physical comfort chance afforded him; the
fleshpots were supplemented with a beverage, stronger and more welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[pg 45]</span>than
that which bubbled and trickled so musically at his feet. One day a box was
washed ashore; a message from the civilized centers to the field of
primitive man! On its cover were the words, "Via sailing vessel, <i>Lord
Nelson</i>" followed by the address. The convict pried the boards apart and
gave a shout. Rum!--and plenty of it!--bottle after bottle, in an overcoat
of straw, nestling lovingly one upon another. The man licked his lips;
knocked off a neck, drank deep, and then, stopping many times, carried his
treasure to his bower.</p>

<p>Day after day turned its page, merged into the past; sometimes,
perforce, he got up, and, not a pleasant thing to look at, staggered to the
beach with his club. There he would slay some crawling thing from the sea,
return with his prize to mingle eating with drinking, until sated with
both, he would fall back unconscious among the flowers. But the prolonged
indulgence began to have a marked effect on his store; bottle after bottle
was tossed off; the empty shells flung aside to the daisies. At length the
day came when only two bottles remained <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[pg 46]</span>in the case, one full pair,
sole survivors of the lot. The man took them out, set them up and regarded
them; a sense of impending disaster, of imminent tragedy, shivered through
his dulled consciousness. He reached for the bottles and fondled them,
started to knock the head from one and put it down. Resisting desire, he
told himself he would have a look at the beach; the ocean had generously
cast one box of well-primed bottles at his feet; perhaps it would repeat
its hospitable action and make him once more the recipient of its bounty.
The thought buoyed him to the shore; the sea lapped the sand with Lydian
whispers, and there, beyond the edge of the soft singing ripples, he saw
something that made him rub his dazed eyes.</p>

<p>A box!--a big box!--a box as tall as he was! No paltry dozen or two this
time! Perhaps there was whisky, too; and the bubbling stuff the long-necked
lords had sometimes pressed upon him in the past, when he had "ousted" his
man and put quids in their pockets; or some of that fiery
<i>vin</i>--something he had once indulged in with a Johnny Frenchman <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[pg 47]</span>before he
took to the tunnel, when he had been free to swagger through old Leicester
Square. Anyhow, he would soon find out, and, rushing through the water, he
laid a proprietary hand on the box. But to his disappointment, he could not
move it; strong though he was, its great weight defied him. Ingenuity came
to his aid, for, after a moment's pondering, he left the box to the sea and
made his way back to the forest. When he returned he bore on his shoulder a
straight, stout limb which he had wrenched from a tree, and in his hand he
carried a great stone. The former became a lever, the latter, a fulcrum;
and, by patient exercise of one of the simple principles of physics, he
managed, at length, to transfer the large box from ocean to land.</p>

<p>To break it open was his next problem, and no easy one, for the boards
were thick, the nails many and formidable. A long time he battered and
battered in vain with his rocks, but, after an hour or so, he succeeded in
splintering his way through the tough pine. His exertions did not end here;
an inner sheeting <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48"></a>[pg 48]</span>of tin caused him to frown; more furiously
he attacked this with sharp bits of coral, cutting and bruising his hands.
Unmindful of pain, he was enabled at length to pull back a portion of the
protecting metal and reveal the contents of the packing-case. In his
befuddled, half-crazed condition, he had thought only of bottles; what he
found proved a different sort of merchandise.</p>

<p>Maddened, he tossed and scattered the contents of the box on the beach.
The ocean had deceived him, laughed at him, cheated him. He turned from the
shore unsteadily, walked back to his camp and knocked the neck from one of
the two remaining bottles. A few hours later, sodden, sottish, he lay
without motion, face to the sky. And as he breathed thickly, one bleeding
hand still holding the empty bottle, a bird from an overhanging branch
looked down upon him: a tiny bird, little bigger than his thumb, that
carried a bright, beautiful spot of red on its breast, cocked its head
questioningly.</p>

<p>London, in the spring! Sunshine; the Thames agleam with silver ripples,
singing as it flows; red sails! Joyous London that has emerged from fogs
and basks beneath blue skies! Thoroughfares that give forth a glad hum;
wheels singing, too; whips that crack in sprightly arpeggios. On the
streets, people, not shadows, who walk with a swing; who really seem to
breathe and not slink uncannily by! Eyes that regard you with human
expression; faces that seem capable of emotion; figures adorned in keeping
with the bright realities of the moment. London; old London young again;
grimy, repulsive London now bright, shimmering, beautiful!</p>

<p>In such a London, on such a day, about ten <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[pg 50]</span>o'clock in the morning, three
persons whose appearance distinguished them from the ordinary passers-by,
turned into a narrow thoroughfare not far from the Strand.</p>

<p>"Quite worth while going to hear John Steele conduct for his client, I
assure you!" observed one, a tall, military-looking man, who walked with a
slight limp and carried a cane. "He's a new man, but he's making his mark.
When he asked to be admitted to the English bar, he surprised even his
examiners. His summing-up in the Doughertie murder case was, I heard his
lordship remark, one of the most masterly efforts he ever listened to. Just
tore the circumstantial evidence to pieces and freed his man! Besides his
profession at the bar, he is an unusually gifted criminologist; takes a
strong personal interest in the lowest riffraff; is writing a book, I
understand--one of the kind that will throw a new light on the
subject."</p>

<p>"Just what is a criminologist?" The speaker, a girl of about eighteen,
turned as she lightly asked the question, to glance over her <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[pg 51]</span>shoulder
toward several persons who followed them.</p>

<p>"One who seeks to apply to the criminal the methods of psychology,
psychiatry and anthropology," he answered with jesting impressiveness.</p>

<p>She laughed. "But you said this Mr. Steele comes from our part of the
world, did you not, Captain Forsythe?"</p>

<p>"So I understand, Miss Jocelyn. Not much of a person to talk about
himself, don't you know,"--tentatively stroking an imposing pair of
mustaches, tinged with gray,--"but he has mentioned, I believe, living in
New Zealand; or was it Australia?"</p>

<p>"Australia?" the cold, metallic tones of the third person, a man of
about three-and-thirty, inquired. "Most likely the other place, or we
should have heard--"</p>

<p>"True, Lord Ronsdale!" said the other man, pausing before a great door.
"But here we are."</p>

<p>"'All ye who enter, etc'" laughed the girl.</p>

<p>"Not if one comes just to 'do' it, you <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[pg 52]</span>know," was the protesting
answer. "Quite the thing to take in the criminal courts!"</p>

<p>"When one is only a sort of country cousin, a colonial, just come to
town!" she added, waving a small, daintily-gloved hand to the little group
of friends who now approached and joined them. "Captain Forsythe is trying
to persuade me it is a legitimate part of our slumming plan to take in
murder trials, uncle," she said lightly, addressing the foremost of the
new-comers. "Just because it's a fad of his! Speaking of this acquaintance
or friend of yours, Mr. Steele,--you are something of a criminologist, too,
are you not, Captain Forsythe?"</p>

<p>"Well, every man should have a hobby," returned that individual, "and,
although I don't aspire to the long name you call me, I confess to a slight
amateur interest."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale shrugged his shoulders, as to say, every one to his taste;
but the girl laughed.</p>

<p>"Slight?" she repeated. "Would you believe it, aunt"--to a portly lady
among those who had approached--"he never misses a murder <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[pg 53]</span>trial! I
believe he likes to watch the poor fellows fighting for their lives, to
study their faces, their expressions when they're being sentenced, perhaps,
to one of those horrible convict ships!"</p>

<p>"Don't speak of them, my dear Jocelyn!" returned that worthy person,
with a shudder. "When I think of the <i>Lord Nelson</i>, and that awful
night--"</p>

<p>"You were three days in an open boat before being sighted and picked up,
I believe, Lady Wray?" observed Captain Forsythe.</p>

<p>"Three days? Years!" returned the governor's wife. "At least, they
seemed so to me! I thought every moment would be our last and goodness
knows why it wasn't! How we managed to survive it--"</p>

<p>"Narrow squeak, certainly!" said Lord Ronsdale, his lids lowering
slightly. "But all's well that ends well, and--"</p>

<p>"Every one behaved splendidly," interposed Sir Charles. "You," gazing
contemplatively at the girl, "were but a child then, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>She did not answer; the beautiful face had <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[pg 54]</span>abruptly changed; all
laughter had gone from the clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"She is thinking of the convict who saved her!" observed Sir Charles in
an explanatory tone to Captain Forsythe. "Quite an interesting episode,
'pon honor! Tell you about it later. Never saw anything finer, or better.
And the amazing part of it is, the fellow looked like a brute, had the low,
ignorant face of an ex-bruiser. He'd gone to the bad, taken to drink, and
committed I don't know how many crimes! Yet that man, the lowest of the
low--"</p>

<p>"You must not speak of him that way!" The girl's hands were clasped; the
slender, shapely figure was very straight. Her beautiful blue eyes, full of
varying lights, flashed, then became dimmed; a suspicion of mist blurred
the long, sweeping lashes. "He had a big, noble spark in his soul. And I
think of him many, many times!" she repeated, the sweet, gay lips trembling
sensitively. "Brave fellow! Brave fellow!" The words fell in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[pg
55]</span>"Fortunate fellow, I should say, to be so remembered by you, Miss
Jocelyn!" interposed Captain Forsythe. "Eh, Ronsdale?"</p>

<p>"Fortunate, indeed!" the thin lips replied stiffly.</p>

<p>"Pity he should have been drowned though!" Captain Forsythe went on. "He
would, I am sure, have made a most interesting study in contrasts!"</p>

<p>She, however, seemed not to hear either compliment--or comment, but
stood for a moment as in a reverie. "I am almost sorry I was persuaded to
come here to-day," she said at length, thoughtfully. "I don't believe I
shall like courts, or," she added, "find them amusing!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Sir Charles laughed. "I have heard his lordship has a pretty
sense of humor, and never fails, when opportunity offers, to indulge
it."</p>

<p>"Even when sentencing people?"</p>

<p>"Well; there is no need of turning the proceedings into a funeral."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[pg
56]</span>"I don't believe I should laugh at his wit," said the girl. "And
is this Mr. John Steele witty, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Anything irrelevant from any one else wouldn't be allowed by
his lordship."</p>

<p>Here Ronsdale lifted his hat. "May happen back this way," he observed.
"That is," looking at Jocelyn Wray, "if you don't object?"</p>

<p>"I? Not at all! Of course, it would bore you--a trial! You are so easily
bored. Is it the club?"</p>

<p>"No; another engagement. Thank you so much for permission to return for
you--very kind. Hope you will find it amusing. Good morning!" And Lord
Ronsdale vanished down the narrow way.</p>

<p>The others of the party entered the court room and were shown to the
seats that Captain Forsythe had taken particular pains to reserve for them.
The case, evidently an interesting one to judge from the number of people
present, was in progress as they quietly settled down in their chairs at
the back. From the vantage point of a slight eminence they found themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[pg
57]</span>afforded an excellent and unimpaired view of his lordship, the
jury, prisoner, witness and barristers. Presumably the case had reached an
acute stage, for even the judge appeared slightly mindful of what was going
on, and allowed his glance to stray toward the witness. The latter, a
little man, in cheap attire flashily debonnaire if the worse for long
service, seemed to experience difficulty in speaking, to hesitate before
his words, and, when he did answer, to betray in his tone no great amount
of confidence. He looked weary and somewhat crestfallen, as if his will
were being broken down, or subjected to a severe strain, the truth being
ground out of him by some irresistible process.</p>

<p>"That's John Steele cross-examining now!" Captain Forsythe whispered to
the girl. "And that's Dandy Joe, as he's called, one of the police spies,
cheap race-track man and so on, in the box. He came to the front in a
murder trial quite celebrated in its day, and one I always had my own
little theory about. Not that it matters now!" he added with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[pg
58]</span>But the girl was listening to another voice, a clear voice, a
quiet voice, a voice capable of the strongest varying accents. She looked
at the speaker; he held himself with the assurance of one certain of his
ground. His shoulders were straight and broad; he stood like an athlete,
and, when he moved, it was impossible to be unconscious of a certain
physical grace that came from well-trained muscles. He carried his head
high, as if from a habit of thought, of looking up, not down, when he
turned from the pages of the heavy tomes in his study; his face conveyed an
impression of intelligence and intensity; his eyes, dark, deep, searched
fully those they rested on.</p>

<p>He had reached a point in his cross-examination where he had almost
thoroughly discredited this witness for the prosecution, when turning
toward a table to take up a paper, his glance, casually lifting, rested on
the distinguished party in the rear of the room, or rather it rested on one
of them. Against the dark background, the girl's golden hair was
well-calculated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59"></a>[pg 59]</span>to catch the wandering gaze; the flowers in
her hat, the great bunch of violets in her dress added insistent alluring
bits of color in the dim spot where she sat. Erect as a lily stem, she
looked oddly out of place in that large, somber room; there, where the
harsh requiem of bruised and broken lives unceasingly sounded, she seemed
like some presence typical of spring, wafted thither by mistake. The man
continued to regard her. Suddenly he started, and his eyes almost eagerly
searched the lovely, proud face.</p>

<p>His back was turned to the judge, who stirred nervously, but waited a
fraction of a second before he spoke.</p>

<p>"If the cross-examination is finished--" he began.</p>

<p>John Steele wheeled; his face changed; a smile of singular charm
accompanied his answer.</p>

<p>"Your lordship will pardon me; the human mind has its aberrations. At
the moment, by a curious psychological turn, a feature of another <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[pg 60]</span>problem
seized me; it was like playing two games of chess at once. Perhaps your
honor has experienced the sensation?"</p>

<p>His lordship beamed. "Quite so," he observed unctuously. "I have to
confess that once in a great while, although following a case very closely,
I have found it possible to consider at the same time whether I would later
have port or sherry with my canvasback."</p>

<p>Of course every one smiled; the business of the morning ran on, and John
Steele, at length, concluded his cross-examination. "I think, your
Lordship, the question of the reliability of this man, as a witness, in
this, or--any other case--fully established."</p>

<p>"Any other case?" said his lordship. "We are not trying any other
case."</p>

<p>"Not now, your Lordship." John Steele bowed. "I ask your lordship's
indulgence for the"--an instant's ironical light gleamed from the dark
eyes--"superfluity."</p>

<p>"Witness may go," said his lordship bruskly.</p>

<p>Dandy Joe, a good deal damaged in the world's estimation, stepped down;
his erstwhile <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[pg
61]</span>well-curled mustache of brick-dust hue seemed to droop as he
slunk out of the box; he appeared subdued, almost frightened,--quite unlike
the jaunty little cockney that had stepped so blithely forth to give his
testimony.</p>

<p>The witnesses all heard, John Steele, for the defense, spoke briefly;
but his words were well-chosen, his sentences of classic purity. As the
girl listened, it seemed to her not strange that Captain Forsythe, as well
as others, perhaps, should be drawn hither on occasions when this man
appeared. Straight, direct logic characterized the speech from beginning to
end; only once did a suggestion of sentiment--curt pity for that
gin-besotted thing, the prisoner!--obtrude itself; then it passed so
quickly his lordship forgot to intervene, and the effect remained, a flash,
illuminating, Rembrandt-like!</p>

<p>Time slipped by; the judge looked at his watch, bethought him of a big
silver dish filled with an amber-hued specialty of the Ship and Turtle, and
adjourned court. His address interrupted by the exigencies of the moment,
John Steele began mechanically to gather up his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[pg 62]</span>books; his face that had been
marked by the set look of one determined to drive on at his best with a
task, now wore a preoccupied expression. The prisoner whined a question;
Steele did not answer, and some one bustled the man out. Having brought his
volumes together in a little pile, Steele absently separated them again; at
the same time Sir Charles and his party walked toward the bench. They were
met by his lordship and cordially greeted.</p>

<p>"A privilege, Sir Charles, to meet one we have heard of so often, in the
antipodes."</p>

<p>"Thank you. His lordship, Judge Beeson, m'dear, whose decisions--"</p>

<p>"Allow me to congratulate you, sir!" The enthusiastic voice was that of
Captain Forsythe, addressing John Steele. "Your cross-examination was
masterly; had you been in a certain other case, years ago, when the
evidence of that very person on the stand to-day--in the main--convicted a
man of murder, I fancy the result then would have been different!"</p>

<p>John Steele seemed not to hear; his eyes were turned toward the
beautiful girl. She was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63"></a>[pg 63]</span>standing quite close to him now; he could
detect the fragrance of the violets she wore, a fresh sweet smell so
welcome in that close, musty atmosphere.</p>

<p>"My niece, your Lordship, Miss Wray."</p>

<p>Steele saw her bow and heard her speak to that august court personage;
then as the latter, after further brief talk, hurried away--</p>

<p>"Sir Charles, let me present to you Mr. Steele," said Captain Forsythe.
"Lady Wray--"</p>

<p>"Happy to know you, sir," said the governor heartily.</p>

<p>"Miss Jocelyn Wray," added the military man, "who," with a laugh,
"experienced some doubts about a visit of this kind being conducive to
pleasure!"</p>

<p>John Steele took the small gloved hand she gave him; her eyes were very
bright.</p>

<p>"I enjoyed--I don't mean that--I am so glad I came," said the girl. "And
heard you!" she added.</p>

<p>He thanked her in a low tone, looking at her hand as he dropped it.
"You,--you are making <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
id="Page_64"></a>[pg 64]</span>England your home?" His voice was singularly
hesitating!</p>

<p>"Yes." She looked at him a little surprised. "At least, for the present!
But how--" she broke off. "I suppose, though, you could tell by my accent.
I've lived nearly all my life in Australia, and--"</p>

<p>Sir Charles, interrupting, reminded them of an appointment; the party
turned. A slender figure inclined itself very slightly toward John Steele;
a voice wished him good morning. The man stood with his hands on his books;
it did not occur to him to accompany her to the door. Suddenly he looked
over his shoulder; at the threshold, she, too, had turned her head. An
instant their glances met; the next, she was gone.</p>

<h3><a name='AT_THE_OPERA'></a>AT THE OPERA</h3>


<p>When John Steele left the court toward the end of the day, he held his
head as a man who thinks deeply. From the door he directed his steps toward
Charing Cross. But only to wheel abruptly, and retrace his way. He was not
an absent-minded man, yet he had been striding unconsciously not toward his
customary destination at that hour, the several chambers at once his office
and his home. For a moment the strong face of the man relaxed, as if in
amusement at his own remissness; gradually however, it once more resumed
its expression of musing thoughtfulness. The stream of human beings, in the
main, flowed toward him; he breasted the current as he had for many
evenings, only this night he did not look into the faces of these, his
neighbors; the great city's concourse of atoms swept unmeaningly by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[pg
66]</span>Turning into a narrow way, not far from the embankment, he
stopped before the door of a solid-looking brick building, let himself in,
and made his way up-stairs. On the third floor he applied another and
smaller key to another lock and, from a hall, entered a large apartment,
noteworthy for its handsome array of books that reached from floor to
ceiling wherever there was shelf space. Most of these volumes were soberly
bound in conventional legal garb but others in elegant, more gracious
array, congregated, a little cosmopolitan community, in a section by
themselves.</p>

<p>Passing through this apartment, John Steele stepped into that adjoining,
the sitting-and dining-room. The small table had already been set; the
sun's dying rays that shot through the window revealed snowy linen,
brightly gleaming silver and a number of papers and letters. They showed,
also, a large cage with a small bird that chirped as the man came in; John
Steele looked at it a moment, walked to a mirror and looked at himself.
Long the deep eyes studied the firm resolute face; they seemed endeavoring
to gaze <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[pg
67]</span>beyond it; but the present visage, like a shadow, waved before
him. The man's expression became inscrutable; stepping to the window, he
gazed out on the Thames. A purplish glimmer lent enchantment to the noble
stream; it may be as he looked upon it, his thoughts flowed with the river,
past dilapidated structures, between whispering reeds on green banks, to
the sea!</p>

<p>A discreet rapping at the door, followed by the appearance of a
round-faced little man, with a tray, interrupted further contemplation or
reverie on John Steele's part. Seating himself at the table, he responded
negatively to the servant's inquiry if "anythink" else would be required,
and when the man had withdrawn, mechanically turned to his letters and to
his simple evening repast. He ate with no great evidence of appetite, soon
brushed the missives, half-read, aside, and pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>Lighting a pipe he picked up one of the papers, and for some moments his
attention seemed fairly divided between a casual inspection of the light
arabesques that ascended in clouds from his lips and the heavy-looking
columns <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[pg
68]</span>of the morning sheet. Suddenly, however, the latter dissipated
his further concern in his pipe; he put it down and spread out the big
paper in both hands. Amid voluminous wastes of type an item, in the court
and society column, had caught his eye:</p>

<blockquote><p></p>
"Sir Charles and Lady Wray, who are intending
henceforth to reside in England, have
returned to the stately Wray mansion in Piccadilly,
where they will be for the season. Our
well-known Governor and his Lady are accompanied
by their niece, the beautiful and accomplished
Miss Jocelyn Wray, only child of Sir
Charles' younger brother, the late Honorable
Mr. Richard Wray, whose estate included enormous
holdings in Australia as well as several
thousand acres in Devonshire. This charming
young colonial has already captivated London
society."

<p>John Steele read carefully this bit of news, and then re-read it; he
even found himself guilty of perusing all the other paragraphs; the comings
and goings, the fine doings! They related to a world he had thought little
about; a world <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[pg
69]</span>within the world; just as the people who lived in tunnels and
dark passages constituted another world within the world. Her name danced
in illustrious company; here were dukes and earls and viscounts; a
sprinkling of the foreign element: begums, emirs, the nation's guests. He
saw, also, "Sir Charles, Lady Wray and Miss Wray" among the long list of
box-holders for that night at the opera, a gala occasion, commanded by
royalty for the entertainment of royalty, and, incidentally, of certain
barbarian personages who had come across the seas to be diplomatically
coddled and fed.</p>

<p>Folding his newspaper, John Steele turned to his legal papers; strove to
replace idleness by industry; but the spirit of work failed to respond. He
looked at his watch, rang sharply a bell.</p>

<p>"Put out my clothes," he said to the servant who appeared with a lamp,
"and have a cab at the door."</p>

<p>The opera had already begun, but pandemonium still reigned about the
box-office, and it was half an hour before John Steele succeeded <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[pg 70]</span>in
reaching the little aperture, with a request for anything that chanced to
be left down-stairs. Armed with a bit of pasteboard, Steele was stopped as
he was about to enter. A thunder of applause from within, indicating that
the first act had come to an end, was followed by the usual egress of black
and white figures, impatient for cigarettes and light lobby gossip.</p>

<p>"Divine, eh? The opera, I mean!" A voice accosted John Steele, and,
turning, he beheld a familiar face with black whiskers, that of Captain
Forsythe. "This is somewhat different from the morning's environment?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other. "But your first question," with a smile, "I'm
afraid I can't answer. I've just come; and, if I hadn't--well, I'm no judge
of music."</p>

<p>"Then you must look as if you were!" laughed the captain frankly. "Don't
know one jolly note from another, but, for goodness' sake, don't betray me.
Just been discussing trills and pizzicatos with Lady Wray."</p>

<p>For a few moments they continued their talk; chance had made them known
to each other some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71"></a>[pg 71]</span>time before, and Captain Forsythe had
improved every opportunity to become better acquainted with one for whom he
entertained a frank admiration. Steele's reserve, however, was not easily
penetrated; he accepted and repaid the other's advances with uniform
courtesy but Forsythe could not flatter himself the acquaintance had
progressed greatly since their first meeting.</p>

<p>A bell sounded; John Steele, excusing himself, entered the auditorium
and was shown to his seat. It proved excellently located, and, looking
around, he found himself afforded a comprehensive view of a spectacle
brilliant and dazzling. Boxes shone with brave hues; gems gleamed
over-plentifully; here and there, accentuating the picture, the gorgeous
colors of some eastern prince stood out like the brighter bits in a
kaleidoscope. Steele's glance swept over royalty, rank and condition. It
took in persons who were more than persons--personages; it passed over the
impassive face of a dark ameer who looked as if he might have stepped from
one of the pages of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[pg 72]</span>and lingered on a box a
little farther to one side. Here were seated Sir Charles and his wife and
party; and among them he could discern the features of Jocelyn Wray--not
plainly, she was so far away! Only her golden hair appeared distinct amid
many tints.</p>

<p>The curtain went up at last; the music began; melodies that seemed born
in the springtime succeeded one another. Perennial in freshness, theme
followed theme; what joy, what gladness; what merriment, what madness! John
Steele, in the main, kept his attention directed toward the stage; once or
twice he glanced quickly aside and upward; now in the dimness, however, the
people in the boxes conveyed only a vague shadowy impression. How long was
the act; how short? It came to a sudden end; after applause and bravos, men
again got up and walked out; he, too, left his seat and strolled toward the
back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Steele! One moment!" He found himself once more addressed by the
good-humored Captain Forsythe. "Behold in me a Mercury, committed to an
imperative mission. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"
id="Page_73"></a>[pg 73]</span>You are commanded to appear--not in the
royal box--but in Sir Charles'."</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Wray's?" John Steele regarded the speaker quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed the other. "You see I happened to mention I had seen you.
'Why didn't you bring him with you to the box?' queried Sir Charles. He, by
the by, went in for law himself, before he became governor. 'Only had time
to shake hands this morning!' 'Yes, why didn't you?' spoke up Miss Jocelyn.
'You <i>command</i> me to bring him?' I inquired. 'By all means!' she
laughed, 'I command.' So here I am."</p>

<p>John Steele did not answer, but Captain Forsythe, without waiting for a
reply, turned and started up the broad stairway. The other, after a
moment's hesitation, followed, duly entered one of the larger boxes, spoke
to Sir Charles and his wife and returned the bow of their niece. Amid
varied platitudes Steele's glance turned oftenest to the girl. She was
dressed in white; a snowy boa drooped from the slender bare <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[pg 74]</span>shoulders
as if it might any moment slip off; a string of pearls, each one with a
pearl of pure light in the center, clasped her throat. In her eyes the
brightness seemed to sing of dancing cadenzas; her lips, slightly parted,
wore the faint suggestion of a smile, as if some canticle or clear cadence
had just trembled from them. The small shoe that peeped from beneath silken
folds tapped softly to rhythms yet lingering; on her cheeks two small roses
unfolded their glad petals.</p>

<p>"I trust Captain Forsythe did not repeat that absurd remark of mine?"
she observed lightly, when John Steele, after a few moments' general talk,
found himself somehow by her side.</p>

<p>"About 'commanding'?"</p>

<p>"So he did?" she answered gaily. "He told me he was going to. It is like
him; he poses as a <i>bel esprit</i>. Stupid, was it not?"</p>

<p>He answered a word in the negative; the girl smiled; where other men
would press the opportunity for a compliment he apparently found no
opening.</p>

<p>She waved her hand to the seat next to her, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[pg 75]</span>and as he sat down--"Isn't it
splendid!" irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"The spectacle, or the opera?" he asked slowly, looking into blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"It was the opera I meant. I suppose the spectacle is very grand; but,"
enthusiastically, "it was the music I was thinking of--how it grips one!
Tell me what you think of <i>The Barber</i>, Mr. Steele."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my views wouldn't be very interesting," he answered. "I know
nothing whatever about music."</p>

<p>"Nothing?" Her eyes widened a little; in her accent was mild wonder.</p>

<p>He looked down at the shimmering white folds near his feet. "In earlier
days my environment was not exactly a musical one."</p>

<p>"No? I suppose you were engaged in more practical concerns?"</p>

<p>He did not answer directly. "Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me
something about Rossini's music, Miss Wray?"</p>

<p>"I tell you?" Her light silvery laugh rang out. "And Captain Forsythe
has only been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[pg
76]</span>telling me--all of us--that you were one of the best informed men
he had ever met."</p>

<p>"You see how wrong he was!"</p>

<p>"Quite!" The blue eyes regarded him sidewise. He, the keen, strong man,
so assured, so invincible in the court room, sat most humbly by her side,
confessing his ignorance, want of knowledge about something every
school-girl is mistress of! "Or, perhaps, it is because your world is so
different from mine! Music, laughter, the traditions of Italian <i>bel
canto</i>, you have no room for them, they are too light, too trifling. You
are above them," poising her fair head a little higher.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have been above me," he answered, his tone unconsciously
taking an accent of gaiety from the lightness of hers.</p>

<p>The abrupt appearance of the musicians and the dissonances attendant on
tuning, interrupted her response; Steele rose and was about to take his
departure, when Sir Charles intervened.</p>

<p>"Why don't you stay?" he asked, with true colonial heartiness. "Plenty
of room! Unless you've a better place! Two vacant chairs!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[pg
77]</span>John Steele looked around; he saw three vacant chairs and took
one, a little aside and slightly behind the young girl, while the
governor's wife, who had moved from the front at the conclusion of the
previous act, now returned to her place, next her niece. During the act,
some one came in and took a seat in the background; if Steele heard, he did
not look around. His gaze remained fastened on the stage; between him and
it--or them, art's gaily attired illusions!--a tress of golden hair
sometimes intervened, but he did not move. Through threads like woven
flashes of light he regarded the scene of the poet's fantasy. Did they make
her a part of it,--did they seem to the man the fantasy's intangible
medium, its imagery? Threads of gold, threads of melody! He saw the former,
heard the latter. They rose and fell wilfully, capriciously, with many an
airy and fanciful turn. The man leaned his head on his hand; a clear strain
died like a filament of purest metal gently broken. She breathed a little
quicker; leaned farther forward; now her slender figure obtruded slightly
between him and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78"></a>[pg 78]</span>the performers. He seemed content with a
partial view of the stage, and so remained until the curtain went down. The
girl turned; in her eyes was a question.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" said the man, looking at her.</p>

<p>"Charming! What colorature! And the bravura!" Captain Forsythe applauded
vigorously.</p>

<p>"You've never met Lord Ronsdale, I believe, Mr. Steele?" Sir Charles'
voice, close to his ear, inquired.</p>

<p>"Lord Ronsdale!" John Steele looked perfunctorily around toward the back
of the box and saw there a face faintly illumined in the light from the
stage: a cynical face, white, mask-like. Had his own features not been set
from the partial glow that sifted upward, the sudden emotion that swept
Steele's countenance would have been observed. A sound escaped his lips;
was drowned, however, in a renewed outbreak of applause. The diva came
tripping out once more, the others, too--bowing, smiling--recipients of
flowers. John Steele's hand had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79"></a>[pg 79]</span>gripped his knee tightly; he was no longer
aware of the stage, the people, even Jocelyn Wray. The girl's attention had
again centered on the actors; she with the others had been oblivious to the
glint of his eyes, the hard, set expression of his features.</p>

<p>"Old friend, don't you know," went on the voice of Sir Charles when this
second tumult of applause had subsided. "Had one rare adventure together.
One of the kind that cements a man to you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the light in the theater flared up; John Steele, no longer
hesitating, uncertain, rose; his face had regained its composure. He
regarded the slender, aristocratic figure of the nobleman in the
background; faultlessly dressed, Lord Ronsdale carried himself with his
habitual languid air of assurance. The two bowed; the stony glance of the
lord met the impassive one of the man. Then a puzzled look came into the
nobleman's eyes; he gazed at Steele more closely; his glance cleared.</p>

<p>"Thought for an instant I'd seen you somewhere <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[pg 80]</span>before, b'Jove!" he drawled
in his metallic tone. "But, of course, I haven't. Never forget a face,
don't you know."</p>

<p>"I may not say so much, may not have the diplomat's gift of always
remembering people to the extent your lordship possesses it, but I am
equally certain I have never before enjoyed the honor of being presented to
your lordship!" said John Steele. The words were punctiliously spoken, his
accents as cold as the other's. An infinitesimal trace of constraint seemed
to have crept into the box; Steele turned and holding out his hand, thanked
Sir Charles and his wife for their courtesy.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Wray gazed around. "You are leaving before the last act?" she
said with an accent of surprise.</p>

<p>He looked down at her. "Not through preference!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she laughed. "Business before--music, of course!"</p>

<p>"Our day at home, Mr. Steele, is Thursday," put in the governor's lady,
majestically gracious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[pg
81]</span>"And you'll meet a lot of learned people only too glad to talk
about music," added the young girl in a light tone. "That is, if you were
sincere in your request for knowledge, and care to profit by the
opportunity?"</p>

<p>His face, which had been contained, impassive, now betrayed in the
slightest degree an expression of irresolution. Her quick look caught it,
became more whimsical; he seemed actually, for an instant, asking himself
if he should come. She laughed ever so slightly; the experience was novel;
who before had ever weighed the pros and cons when extended this privilege?
Then, the next moment, the blue eyes lost some of their mirth; perhaps his
manner made her feel the frank informality she had unconsciously been
guilty of; she regarded him more coldly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "You are very good. I shall be most glad."</p>

<p>And bowing to her and to the others he once more turned; as he passed
Lord Ronadsle, the eyes of the two men again met; those of the nobleman
suddenly dilated and he started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[pg
82]</span>"B'Jove!" he exclaimed, his gaze following the retreating
figure.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Sir Charles looked around. "Recall where you thought you
saw him?"</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale did not at once answer and Sir Charles repeated his
question; the nobleman mechanically raised his hand to his face. "Yes; a
mere fugitive resemblance," he answered rather hurriedly. "Some
one--you--you never met. Altogether quite a different sort of person, don't
you know!" regaining his drawl.</p>

<p>"Well," observed Sir Charles, "fugitive resemblances will happen!"</p>

<p>John Steele was rather late in arriving at the house of Sir Charles Wray
in Piccadilly the following Thursday. But nearly every one else was late,
and, perhaps knowing the fashionable foible, he had purposely held back to
avoid making himself conspicuous by being prompt. The house, his
destination, was not unlike other dwellings on that historic thoroughfare;
externally it was as monotonous as the average London mansion. The
architect had disdained any attempt at ornamentation. As if fearful of
being accused of emulating his brother-in-art across the channel, he had
put up four walls and laid on a roof; he had given the front wall a
slightly outward curve. In so doing, he did not reason why; he was merely
following precedent that had created this incomprehensible convexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[pg
84]</span>But within, the mansion made a dignified and at the same time a
pleasant impression. John Steele, seated at the rear of a spacious room,
where he a few moments later found himself among a numerous company, looked
around on the old solid furnishings, the heavy rich curtains and those
other substantial appurtenances to a fine and stately town house. That
funereal atmosphere common to many homes of an ancient period was, however,
lacking. The observer felt as if some recent hand, the hand of youth, had
been busy hereabouts indulging in light touches that relieved and gladdened
the big room. Hues, soft and delicate, met the eye here and there; rugs of
fine pattern favored the glance, while tapestries of French workmanship
bade it wander amid scenes suggestive of Arcadia. Many found these
innovations to their liking; others frowned upon them; but everybody
flocked to the house.</p>

<p>The program on the present occasion included a poet and a woman
novelist. The former, a Preraphaelite, led his hearers through dim <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[pg 85]</span>mazes,
Hyrcanian wilds. The novelist on the other hand was direct; in following
her there seemed no danger of losing the way. At the conclusion of the
program proper, an admirer of the poet asked if their young hostess would
not play a certain musical something, the theme of one of the bard's
effusions, and at once Jocelyn Wray complied. Lord Ronsdale stood
sedulously near, turning the leaves; Steele watched the deft hand; it was
slim, aristocratic and suggested possibilities in legerdemain.</p>

<p>"An attractive-looking pair!" whispered a woman near John Steele to
another of her sex, during a louder passage in the number. "Are they--"</p>

<p>"I don't know; my dear. Perhaps. She's extremely well-off in this
world's goods, and he has large properties, but--a diminishing income." She
lowered her voice rather abruptly as the cadence came to a pause. The music
went on again to its appointed and spirited climax.</p>

<p>"Was formerly in the diplomatic service, I <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[pg 86]</span>believe;"--the voice also
went on--"has strong political aspirations, and, with a wealthy and clever
wife--"</p>

<p>"A girl might do worse. He is both cold and capable--an ideal
combination for a political career--might become prime minister--with the
prestige of his family and hers to--"</p>

<p>John Steele stirred; the whispering ceased. My lord turned the last
page; the girl rose and bent for an instant her fair head. And as Steele
looked at her, again there came over him--this time, it may be, not without
a certain bitterness!--an impression of life and its joys--spring-tide and
sunshine, bright, remote!--so remote--for him--</p>

<p>A babel of voices replaced melody; the people got up. A number lingered;
many went, after speaking to their hostesses and Sir Charles. John Steele,
at the rear, looked at the door leading into the main hall toward the young
girl, then stepped across the soft rugs and spoke to her. She answered in
the customary manner and others approached. He was about to draw back to
leave, when--</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[pg
87]</span>"Oh, Mr. Steele," she said, "my uncle wishes to see you before
you go. He was saying he had some--"</p>

<p>"Quite right, my dear!" And Sir Charles, who had approached, took John
Steele's arm. "Some curious old law books I picked up to-day at a bargain
and want your opinion of!" he went on, leading the other into a lofty and
restful apartment adjoining, the library. Steele looked around him; his
gaze brightened as it rested on the imposing and finely bound volumes.</p>

<p>"You have a superb collection of books," he observed with a sudden quick
look at his host.</p>

<p>"Yes; I rather pride myself on my library," said Sir Charles
complacently. "Lost a good many of the choicest though," he went on in
regretful tones, "some years ago, as I was returning to Australia. A rare
lot of law books, a library in themselves, as well as a large collection of
the classics, the world's poets and historians, went down with the
ill-fated <i>Lord Nelson</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah?" John Steele looked away. "A <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[pg 88]</span>great mart, London, for fine
editions!" he said absently after a pause.</p>

<p>"It is. But here are those I spoke of." And Sir Charles indicated a
number of volumes on a large center table. John Steele handled them
thoughtfully and for some time his host ran on about them. A choice copy of
one of the Elizabethan poets, intruding itself in that august company, then
attracted Steele's attention; he picked it up, weighed and caressed it with
gentle fingers.</p>

<p>"Who shall measure the influence of--a little parcel like this?" he said
at length lightly.</p>

<p>"True." Sir Charles' eye caught the title. "As Portia says: 'It blesseth
him that gives and him that takes.' Excellent bit of binding that, too!
But," with new zest, "take any interest in rare books of the ring, full of
eighteenth century colored prints, and so on?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, at present, that the doings of the ring or the history of
pugilists attract me."</p>

<p>"That's because you've never seen an honest, hard-fought battle,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"A flattering designation, I should say, of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[pg 89]</span>the spectacle of two brutes
disfiguring their already repulsive visages!"</p>

<p>"Two brutes?--disfiguring?"--the drawling voice of Lord Ronsdale who had
at that moment stepped in, inquired. "May I ask what the--talk is
about?"</p>

<p>Sir Charles turned. "Steele was differing from me about a good, old,
honest English sport."</p>

<p>"Sport?" Lord Ronsdale dropped into a chair and helped himself to whisky
and soda conveniently near.</p>

<p>"I refer to the ring--its traditions--its chronicles--"</p>

<p>"Ah!" The speaker raised his glass and looked at John Steele. The latter
was nonchalantly regarding the pages of a book he yet held; his face was
half-turned from the nobleman. The clear-cut, bold profile, the easy,
assured carriage, so suggestive of strength, seemed to attract, to compel
Lord Ronsdale's attention.</p>

<p>"For my part," went on Sir Charles in a somewhat disappointed tone, "I
am one who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[pg
90]</span>views with regret the decadence of a great national pastime."</p>

<p>He regarded Ronsdale; the latter set down his glass untasted. "My own
opinion," he said crisply; then his face changed; he looked toward the
door.</p>

<p>"Well, it's over!" the light tones of Jocelyn Wray interrupted; the girl
stood on the threshold, glancing gaily from one to the other. "Did you tell
my uncle, Mr. Steele, what you thought of his purchase? I see, while on his
favorite subject, he has forgotten to offer you a cigar."</p>

<p>Sir Charles hastened to repair his remissness.</p>

<p>"But how," she went on, "did it go? The program, I mean. Have you
forgiven me yet for asking you to come, Mr. Steele?"</p>

<p>"Forgiven?" he repeated. Lord Ronsdale's eyes narrowed on them.</p>

<p>"Confess," she continued, sinking to the arm of a great chair, "you had
your misgivings?"</p>

<p>He regarded the supple, slender figure, so airily poised. As she bent
forward, he noticed in her hair several flowers shaped like primroses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[pg 91]</span>but
light crimson in hue. "What misgivings was it possible to have?" he
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh," she replied, "the usual masculine ones! Misgivings, for example,
about stepping out of the routine. Routine that makes slaves of men!" with
an accent slightly mocking. "And stepping into what? Society! The bugbear
of so many men! Poor Society! What flings it has to endure! By the way, did
your convict get off?"</p>

<p>"Get off? What--"</p>

<p>"The one you represented--is that the word?--when we were in court."</p>

<p>"Yes; he was acquitted."</p>

<p>"I am glad; somehow you made me feel he was innocent."</p>

<p>"I believed in him," said John Steele.</p>

<p>"And yet the evidence was very strong against him! If some one else had
appeared for him--Do you think many innocent people have been--hanged, or
sent out of the country, Mr. Steele?" Her eyes looked brighter, her face
more earnest now.</p>

<p>"Evidence can play odd caprices."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[pg
92]</span>"Still, your average English juryman is to be depended on!" put
in Lord Ronsdale quickly.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" An instant Steele's eyes rested on the speaker. "No
doubt you are right." A sardonic flash seemed to play on the nobleman. "At
all events you voice the accepted belief."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you defend, don't prosecute people, Mr. Steele," said the girl
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"A pleasanter task, perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Speaking of sending prisoners out of the country," broke in Sir
Charles, "I am not in favor of the penal system myself."</p>

<p>"Rather a simple way of getting rid of undesirables--transportation--it
has always seemed to me," dissented Lord Ronsdale.</p>

<p>"Don't they sometimes escape and come back to England?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"Not apt to, when death for returning stares them in the face," remarked
the nobleman.</p>

<p>"Death!" The girl shivered slightly.</p>

<p>John Steele smiled. "The penalty should certainly prove efficacious," he
observed lightly.</p>

<p>"Is not such a penalty--for returning, I <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[pg 93]</span>mean--very severe, Mr.
Steele?" asked Jocelyn Wray.</p>

<p>"That," he laughed, "depends somewhat on the point of view, the
criminal's, or society's!" His gaze returned to her; the bright bit of
color in her hair again seemed to catch and hold his glance. "But," with a
sudden change of tone, "will you explain something to me, Miss Wray? Those
flowers you wear--surely they are primroses, and yet--"</p>

<p>"Crimson," said the girl. "You find that strange. It is very simple. If
you will come with me a moment." She rose, quickly crossed the room to a
door at the back, and Steele, following, found himself in a large
conservatory that looked out upon an agreeable, if rather restricted,
prospect of green garden. Several of the windows of the glass addition were
open and the warm sunshine and air entered. A butterfly was fluttering
within; in a corner, a bee busied himself buzzing loudly between flowers
and sips of saccharine sweetness. Jocelyn Wray stepped in its direction,
stooped. The sunlight touched the white neck, where spirals <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[pg 94]</span>of gold
nestled, and fell over her gown in soft, shifting waves.</p>

<p>"You see?" She threw over her shoulder a glance at him; he looked down
at primroses, pale yellow; a few near-by were half-red, or spotted with
crimson; others, still, were the color of those that nodded in her hair.
"You can imagine how it has come about?"</p>

<p>He regarded a great bunch of clustering red roses--the winged marauder
hovering noisily over. "I think I can guess. The bees have carried the hue
of the roses to them."</p>

<p>"Hue!" cried the girl, with light scorn. "What a prosaic way to express
it! Say the soul, the heart's blood. Some of the primroses have yielded
only a little; others have been transformed."</p>

<p>"You think, then, some flowers may be much influenced by others?"</p>

<p>"They can't help it," she answered confidently.</p>

<p>"Just as some people," he said in a low tone, "can't help taking into
their lives some beautiful <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
id="Page_95"></a>[pg 95]</span>hue born of mere casual contact with some
one, some time."</p>

<p>"What a poetical sentiment!" she laughed. "Really, it deserves a
reward." As he spoke, she plucked a few flowers and held them out in her
palm to him; he regarded her merry eyes, the bright tints.</p>

<p>Erect, with well-assured poise, she looked at him; he took one of the
flowers, gazed at it, a tiny thing in his own great palm, a tiny, red
thing, like a jewel in hue--that reminded him of--what? As through a mist
he saw a spark--where?</p>

<p>"Only one?" she said in the same tone. "You are modest. And you don't
even condescend to put it in your coat?"</p>

<p>He did so; in his gaze was a sudden new expression, something so
compelling, so different, it held her, almost against her will. He seemed
to see her and yet not fully to be aware of her presence; she drew back
slightly. The girl's crimson lips parted as with a suspicion of faint
wonder; the blue eyes, just a little soberer, were, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[pg 96]</span>also, in
the least degree, perplexed. The man's breast suddenly stirred; a
breath--or was it the merest suggestion of a sigh?--escaped the firm lips.
He looked out of the window at the garden, conventional, the arrangement of
lines one expected.</p>

<p>When his look returned to her it was the same he had worn when he had
first stepped forward to speak with her that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the lesson in botany, Miss Wray!" he said easily. "I
shall not forget it."</p>

<p>The other primroses fell from her fingers; with a response equally
careless if somewhat reserved, she turned and re&euml;ntered the library.
Lord Ronsdale regarded both quickly; then started, as he caught sight of
the flower in John Steele's coat. A frown crossed his face and he looked
away to conceal the singularly cold and vindictive gleam that sprang to his
eyes.</p>

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2IV'></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><a name='TIDES_VARYING'></a>TIDES VARYING</h3>


<p>One evening about a fortnight later Lord Ronsdale, in a dissatisfied
frame of mind, strolled along Piccadilly. His face wore a dark look, the
expression of one ill-pleased with fortune's late attitude toward him.
Plans that he had long cherished seemed to be in some jeopardy; he had
begun to flatter himself that the flowery way to all he desired lay before
him and that he had but to tread it, when another, as the soothsayers put
it, had crossed his path.</p>

<p>A plain man, a man without title! Lord Ronsdale told himself Miss
Jocelyn Wray was no better than an arrant coquette, but the next moment
questioned this conclusion. Had she not really been a little taken by the
fellow? Certainly she seemed not averse to his company; when she willed,
and she willed often, she summoned him to her aide. Nor did he now appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[pg
98]</span>reluctant to come at her bidding; self-assertive though he had
shown himself to be he obeyed, <i>sans</i> demur, the wave of my lady's
little hand. Was it a certain largeness and reserve about him that had
awakened her curiosity? From her high social position had she wished merely
to test her own power and amuse herself after a light fashion, surely
youth's and beauty's privilege?</p>

<p>But whatever the girl's motive, her conduct in the matter reacted on my
lord; the fellow was in the way, very much so. How could he himself pay
court to her when she frivolously, if only for the moment, preferred this
commoner's company? That very afternoon my lord, entering the music-room of
the great mansion, had found her at the piano playing for him, her slim
fingers moving over the keys to the tune of one of Chopin's nocturnes. He
had surprised a steady, eloquent look in the fellow's eye turned on her
when she was unconscious of his gaze, a glance the ardency of which there
was no mistaking. It had altered at my lord's rather quiet and abrupt
appearance, crystallized into an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99"
id="Page_99"></a>[pg 99]</span>impersonal icy light, colder even than the
nobleman's own stony stare. He had, perforce, to endure the other's
presence and conversation, an undercurrent to the light talk of the girl
who seemed, Lord Ronsdale thought, a little maliciously aware of the
constraint between the two men, and not at all put out by it.</p>

<p>What made the situation even more anomalous to Ronsdale and the less
patiently to be borne, was that Sir Charles understood and sympathized with
his desires and position in the matter. And why not? Ronsdale's father and
Sir Charles had been old and close friends; there were reasons that pointed
to the match as a suitable one, and Sir Charles, by his general manner and
attitude, had long shown he would put no obstacle in the way of the
nobleman's suit for the hand of his fair niece. As for Lady Wray, Lord
Ronsdale knew that he had in that practical and worldly person a stanch
ally of his wishes; these had not become less ardent since he had witnessed
the unqualified success of the beautiful colonial girl in London; noted how
men, illustrious in various walks of life, grave diplomats, stately <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[pg
100]</span>ambassadors, were swayed by her light charm and impulsive
frankness of youth. And to have her who could have all London at her feet,
including his distinguished self, show a predilection, however short-lived
and capricious, for--</p>

<p>"Confound the cad! Where did he come from? Who are his family--if he has
one!"</p>

<p>Thus ruminating he had drawn near his club, a square, imposing edifice,
when a voice out of the darkness caused him abruptly to pause:</p>

<p>"If it isn't 'is lordship!"</p>

<p>The tones expressed surprise, satisfaction; the nobleman looked down;
gave a slight start; then his face became once more cold, apathetic.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" he said roughly.</p>

<p>The countenance of the fellow who had ventured to accost the nobleman
fell; a vindictive light shone from his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's like a drama at old Drury," he observed, with a slight sneer.
"Only your lordship should have said: 'Who the devil are you?'"</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale looked before him to where, in the distance, near a street
lamp, the figure of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"
id="Page_101"></a>[pg 101]</span>a policeman might be dimly discerned;
then, with obvious intention, he started toward the officer; but the man
stepped in front of him. "No, you don't," he said.</p>

<p>The impassive, steel-like glance of Ronsdale played on the man; a white,
shapely hand began to reach out. "One moment, and I'll give you in charge
as--"</p>

<p>The fellow saw that Ronsdale meant it; he had but an instant to decide;
a certain air of cheap, jaunty assurance he had begun to assume vanished.
"All right," he said quickly, but with a ring of suppressed venom in his
voice. "I'll be off. Your lordship has it all your own way since the
<i>Lord Nelson</i> went down." There was a note of bitterness in his tones.
"Besides, Dandy Joe's not exactly a favorite at headquarters just now,
after the drubbing John Steele gave him."</p>

<p>"John Steele!" Lord Ronsdale looked abruptly round.</p>

<p>The fellow regarded him and ventured to go on: "I was witness for the
police and Mr. Gillett, and he--Steele," with a curse, "had <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[pg 102]</span>me on
the stand. He knows every rook and welsher and every swell magsman, and all
their haunts and habits. And he knows me--blame--" he made use of another
expression more forcible--"if he don't know me as well as if he'd once been
a pal. And now," in an injured tone, "Mr. Gillett calls me hard names for
bringing discredit, as he terms it, on the force."</p>

<p>"What's this to me?"</p>

<p>The fellow stopped short in what he was saying; his small eyes glistened
and he took a step forward. "Your lordship remembers the 'Frisco Pet? Your
lordship remembers him?" he repeated, thrusting an alert face closer.</p>

<p>"I believe there was a prize-fighter of that name," was the calm
reply.</p>

<p>"I say!" The fellow let his jaw fall slightly; he gazed at the nobleman
with mingled shrewdness and admiration. "Your lordship remembers him
<i>only</i>," with an accent, "as a patron of sport. Tossed a quid on
him"--with a look of full meaning--"as your lordship <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[pg 103]</span>would a
bone to a dog. Perhaps," gaining in audacity, "your lordship would be so
generous as to throw one or two now at one he once favored with his
bounty."</p>

<p>"I--favored you? You lie!" The answer was concise; it cut like a lash;
it robbed the man once more of all his hardihood. He slunk back.</p>

<p>"Very good," he muttered.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale turned and with a sharp swish of his cane walked on. The
other, his eyes resentfully bright, looked after the tall, aristocratic,
slowly departing figure.</p>

<p>As the nobleman ascended the steps of his club he seemed again to be
thinking deeply; within, his preoccupation did not altogether desert him.
In a corner, with the big pages of the <i>Times</i> before him, he read
with scant interest the doings of the day; even a perennial telegram
concerning a threatened invasion of England did not awaken momentary
interest. He passed it over as casually as he did the markets, or a
grudging, conservative item from the police courts, all that the blue
pencil had left of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104"></a>[pg 104]</span>hopeful efforts of some poor
penny-a-liner. From the daily fulminator he had turned to the weekly medium
of fun and fooling, when, from behind another paper, the face of a
gray-haired, good-natured appearing person, quite different off the bench,
chanced to look out at him.</p>

<p>"Eh? That you, Ronsdale?" he said, reaching for a steaming glass of hot
beverage at his elbow. "What do you think of it, this talk of an invasion
by the Monseers?"</p>

<p>"Don't think anything of it."</p>

<p>"Answered in the true spirit of a Briton!" laughed the other. "I fancy,
too, it'll be a long time before John Bull ceases to stamp around, master
of his own shores, or Britannia no longer rules the deep. But how is your
friend, Sir Charles Wray? I had the pleasure of meeting him the other
morning in the court room."</p>

<p>"Same as usual, I imagine, Judge Beeson."</p>

<p>"And his fair niece, she takes kindly to the town and its gaieties?"</p>

<p>"Very kindly," dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[pg
105]</span>"A beautiful girl, our young Australian!" The elder man toyed
with his glass, stirred the contents and sipped. "By the way, didn't I see
John Steele in their box at the opera the other night?"</p>

<p>"It is possible," shortly.</p>

<p>"Rising man, that!" observed the other lightly. "Combination of brains
and force! Did you ever notice his fist? It might belong to a
prize-fighter, except that the hands are perfectly kept! You'd know at once
he was a man accustomed to fighting, who would sweep aside obstacles, get
what he wanted!"</p>

<p>"Think so?" Lord Ronsdale smoked steadily. "You, as a magistrate, I
suppose, know him well?"</p>

<p>"Should hardly go that far; taciturn chap, don't you know! I don't
believe any one really knows him."</p>

<p>"Or about him?" suggested the other, crossing his legs nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Not much; only that he is an alien."</p>

<p>"An alien?" quickly. "Not a colonial?"</p>

<p>"No; he has lived in the colonies--Tasmania, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[pg 106]</span>and so on. But by birth
he's an American."</p>

<p>"An American, eh? And practising at the British bar?"</p>

<p>"Not the first case of the kind; exceptions have been made before, and
aliens 'called,' as we express it. Steele's hobby of criminology brought
him to London, and his earnestness and ability in that line procured for
him the privilege he sought. As member of the incorporated society that
passes upon the qualifications of candidates it was my pleasure to sit in
judgment on him; we raked him fore and aft but, bless you, he stood
squarely on his feet and refused to be tripped."</p>

<p>"So he came to England to pursue a certain line?" said Lord Ronsdale
half to himself.</p>

<p>"A man with a partiality for criminal work would naturally look to the
modern Babylon. Steele apparently works more to gratify that predilection
than for any reward in pounds and pence. Must have private means; have
known him to spend a deal of time and money on cases there couldn't have
been a sixpence in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[pg
107]</span>"How'd he happen to get down in Tasmania? Odd place for a
Yankee!"</p>

<p>"That's one of the questions he wasn't asked," laughingly. "Perhaps what
our Teutonic friends would call the <i>Wander-lust</i> took him there."
Rising, "My compliments to Sir Charles when you see him."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale remained long at the club and the card-table that night;
over the bits of pasteboard, however, his zest failed to flare high,
although instinctively he played with a discernment that came from long
practice. But the sight of a handful of gold pieces here, of a little pile
there, the varying shiftings of the bright disks, as the vagaries of chance
sent them this way or that, seemed to move him in no great degree,--perhaps
because the winning or losing of a few hundred pounds, more or less, would
have small effect on his fortunes or misfortunes. At a late, or rather,
early, hour he pushed back his chair, richer by a few coins that jingled in
his pocket, and, yawning, walked out. Summoning a cab, he got in, but as he
found himself rattling homeward to the chambers <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[pg 108]</span>he had taken in a
fashionable part of town, he was aware that any emotions of annoyance and
discontent experienced earlier that night, had suffered no abatement.</p>

<p>"Tasmania!" The horse's hoofs beat time to vague desultory thoughts; he
stared out, perhaps, in fancy, at southern seas, looked up at stars more
lustrous than those that hung over him now. Then the divers clusters of
points, glowing, insistent, swam around, and he fell into a half doze, from
which he was awakened by the abrupt stopping of the cab. Having paid the
man he went up to his rooms. On the table in an inner apartment, his study,
something bright, white, met his gaze: a note in Jocelyn Wray's
handwriting! Quickly he reached for it and tore it open.</p>

<p>"A party of us ride in the park to-morrow morning. Will you join
us?"</p>

<p>That was all; brief and to the point; Lord Ronsdale frowned.</p>

<p>"A party!" That would include John Steele perhaps. Once before on a
morning, the girl's fair face and dancing eyes had wooed <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[pg 109]</span>Steele
away from his desk, or the court, to the park.</p>

<p>Should he go? The note slipped from his fingers to the carpet; he
permitted it to lie there; the importance to himself and others of his
decision he little realized. Could he have foreseen all that was involved
by his going, or staying away, he would not so carelessly have thrown off
his clothes and retired, dismissing the matter until the morrow, or rather,
until he should chance to waken.</p>

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2V'></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><a name='IN_THE_PARK'></a>IN THE PARK</h3>


<p>Close at hand, the trees in Hyde Park seemed to droop their branches, as
if in sympathy with the gray aspect of the day, while afar, across the
green, the sylvan guardians of the place had either receded altogether in
the gray haze or stood forth like shadowy ghosts. In the foreground, not
far from the main entrance, a number of sheep and their young nibbled
contentedly the wet and delectable grass, and as some bright gown paused or
whisked past, the juxtaposition of fine raiment and young lamb suggested
soft, shifting Bouchers or other dainty French pastorals in paint. The air
had a tang; the dampness enhanced the perfumes, made them fuller and
sweeter, and a joyous sort of melancholy seemed to hold a springtime world
in its grasp.</p>

<p>Into this scene of rural tranquillity rode <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[pg 111]</span>briskly about the middle
of the morning Jocelyn Wray and others. The glow on the girl's cheeks
harmonized with the redness of her lips; the sparkling blue eyes mocked at
all neutral hues; her gown and an odd ribbon or two waved, as it were,
light defiance to motionless things--still leaves and branches, flowers and
buds, drowsy and sleeping. Her mount was deep black, with fine arching neck
and spirited head; on either side of the head, beneath ears sensitive,
delicately pointed, had been fastened a rose, badge of favor from a bunch
nestling at the white throat of the young girl. She rode with a grace and
rhythmical ease suggestive of large experience in the pastime; the slender,
supple figure swayed as if welcoming gladly the swing and the quick rush of
air. Sometimes at her side, again just behind, galloped the horse bearing
John Steele, and, as they went at a fair pace, preceded and followed by
others of a gay party, the eyes of many passers-by turned to regard
them.</p>

<p>"By Jove, they're stunning! It isn't often you see a man put up like
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[pg
112]</span>"Or a girl more the picture of health!"</p>

<p>"And beauty!"</p>

<p>Unconscious of these and other comments from the usual curious
contingent of idlers filling the benches or strolling along the paths, the
girl now set a yet swifter gait, glancing quickly over her shoulder at her
companion: "Do you like a hard gallop? Shall we let them out?"</p>

<p>His brightening gaze answered; they touched their horses and for some
distance raced madly on, passed those in front and left them far behind.
Now Steele's eyes rested on the playing muscles of her superb horse, then
lifted to the lithe form of Jocelyn Wray, the straight shoulders, a bit of
a tress, disordered, floating rebelliously to the wind.</p>

<p>As abruptly as she had pressed her horse to that inspiring speed, she
drew him in to a walk. "Wasn't that worth coming to the park for?" she said
gaily.</p>

<p>He looked at her, at the flowers she readjusted, at the lips,
half-parted to her quick breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[pg
113]</span>"More than worth it."</p>

<p>"You see what you missed in the past," she observed in a tone slightly
mocking.</p>

<p>"You were not here to suggest it," he returned quietly, with gaze only
for blue eyes.</p>

<p>She suffered them to linger. "I suppose I should feel nattered that a
suggestion from little me--"</p>

<p>"A suggestion from little you would, I fancy, go a long ways with many
people." A spark shone now in the man's steady look; the girl seemed not
afraid of it.</p>

<p>"I am fortunate," she laughed. "A compliment from Mr. John Steele!"</p>

<p>"Why not say--the truth?" he observed.</p>

<p>She stroked her horse's glossy neck and smiled furtively at the soft,
velvet surface. "The truth?" she replied. "What is it? Where shall we find
it? Isn't it something the old philosophers were always searching for?
Plato, and--some of the others we were taught of in school."</p>

<p>He started as if to speak, but his answer remained unuttered; the man's
lips closed tighter; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114"></a>[pg 114]</span>a moment he watched the small gloved hand,
then his gaze turned to the gray sky.</p>

<p>"So you see, I call compliments, compliments," she ended lightly.</p>

<p>He offered no comment; the horses moved on; suddenly she looked at him.
One of those odd changes she had once or twice noticed before had come over
John Steele; his face appeared too grave, too reserved; she might almost
fancy a stormy play of emotion behind that mask of immobility. The girl's
long lashes lowered; a slightly puzzled expression shone from her eyes. It
may be she had but the natural curiosity of her sex, that her interest was
compelled, because, although she had studied this man from various
standpoints, his personality, strong, direct in some ways, she seemed
unable to fathom. The golden head tilted; she allowed an impression of his
profile to grow upon her.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she laughingly remarked, "you are not very
interesting?"</p>

<p>He started. "Interesting!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[pg
115]</span>"A penny for your thoughts!" ironically.</p>

<p>"They're not worth it."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>He bent a little nearer; she swept back the disordered lock; an instant
the man seemed to lose his self-possession. "Ah," he began, as if the words
forced themselves from his lips, "if only I might--"</p>

<p>What he had been on the point of saying was never finished; the girl's
quick glance, sweeping an instant ahead, had lingered on some one
approaching from the opposite direction, and catching sight of him, she had
just missed noting that swift alteration in John Steele's tones, the brief
abandonment of studied control, a flare of irresistible feeling.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Lord Ronsdale?" asked the girl, continuing to gaze before
her.</p>

<p>A black look replaced the sudden flame in Steele's gaze; the hand
holding the reins closed on them tightly.</p>

<p>"Rather early for him, I fancy," she said, regarding the slim figure of
the approaching <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116"></a>[pg 116]</span>rider. "With his devotion to clubs and
late hours, you know! Do you, Mr. Steele, happen to belong to any of his
clubs?"</p>

<p>"No." He spoke in a low voice, almost harshly.</p>

<p>Her brow lifted; his face was turned from her. Had he been mindful he
might have noted a touch of displeasure on the proud face, that she
regarded him as from a vague, indefinite distance.</p>

<p>"Lord Ronsdale is a very old friend of my uncle's," she observed
severely, "and--mine!"</p>

<p>Was it that she had divined a deep-seated prejudice or hostility toward
the nobleman hidden in John Steele's breast, that she took this occasion to
let him know definitely that her friends were her friends? "Even when I was
only a child he was very nice to me," she went on.</p>

<p>He remained silent; she frowned, then turned to the nobleman with a
smile. Lord Ronsdale found that her greeting left nothing to be desired;
she who had been somewhat unmindful of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[pg 117]</span>him lately on a sudden
seemed really glad to see him. His slightly tired, aristocratic face
lightened; the sunshine of Jocelyn Wray's eyes, the tonic of youth
radiating from her, were sufficient to alleviate, if not dispel, ennui or
lassitude.</p>

<p>"So good of you!" she murmured conventionally, as Steele dropped
slightly back among the others who had by this time drawn near. "To arrive
at such an unfashionable hour, I mean!"</p>

<p>His pleased but rather suspicious eyes studied her; he answered lightly;
behind them now, he who had been riding with my lady could hear their gay
laughter. Lord Ronsdale was apparently telling her a whimsical story; he
had traveled much, met many people, bizarre and otherwise, and could be
ironically witty when stimulated to the effort. John Steele did not look at
them; when the girl at a turn in the way allowed her glance a moment to
sweep aside toward those following, she could see he was riding with head
slightly down bent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[pg
118]</span>"Good-looking beggar, isn't he," observed the nobleman suddenly,
his gaze sharpened on her.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"That chap, Steele," he answered insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"Is he?" Her voice was flute-like. "What is that noise?" abruptly.</p>

<p>"Noise?" Lord Ronsdale listened. "That's music, or supposed to be!
Unless I am mistaken, <i>The Campbells are Coming</i>," he drawled.</p>

<p>"The Campbells? Oh, I understand! Let us wait!"</p>

<p>They drew in their horses; the black one became restive, eyed with
obvious disapproval a gaily bedecked body of men swinging smartly along
toward them. At their head marched pipers, blowing lustily; behind strode
doughty clansmen, heads up, as became those carrying memories of battles
won. They approached after the manner of veterans who felt that they
deserved tributes of admiration from beholders: that in the piping times of
peace they were bound to be conquerors still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[pg
119]</span>Louder shrieked the wild concords; bare legs flashed nearer;
bright colors flaunted with startling distinctness. And at the sight and
sound, the girl's horse, unaccustomed to the pomp and pride of martial
display, began to plunge and rear. She spoke sharply; tried to control it
but found she could not. Lord Ronsdale saw her predicament but was
powerless to lend assistance, being at the moment engaged in a vigorous
effort to prevent his own horse from bolting.</p>

<p>The bagpipes came directly opposite; the black horse reared viciously;
for the moment it seemed that Jocelyn would either be thrown or that the
affrighted animal would fall over on her, when a man sprang forward and a
hand reached up. He stood almost beneath the horse; as it came down a hoof
struck his shoulder a glancing blow, grazed hard his arm, tearing the
cloth. But before the animal could continue his rebellious tactics a hand
like iron had reached for, grasped the bridle; those who watched could
realize a great strength in the restraining fingers, the unusual power of
Steele's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[pg
120]</span>muscles. The black horse, trembling, soon stood still; the
bagpipes passed on, and Steele looked up at the girl.</p>

<p>"If you care to dismount--"</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "I'm not afraid. Especially," she added lightly,
"with you at the bridle!"</p>

<p>"Few riders could have kept their seats so well," he answered, with
ill-concealed admiration.</p>

<p>"I have always been accustomed to horses. In Australia we ride a great
deal."</p>

<p>"For the instant," his face slightly paler, "I thought something would
happen."</p>

<p>"It might have," she returned, a light in her eyes, "but for a timely
hand. My horse apparently does not appreciate Scotch airs."</p>

<p>"Ugly brute!" Lord Ronsdale, a dissatisfied expression on his handsome
countenance, approached. "A little of the whip--" the words were arrested;
the nobleman stared at John Steele, or rather at the bare arm which the
torn sleeve revealed well above the elbow.</p>

<p>The white, uplifted arm suddenly dropped; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[pg 121]</span>Steele drew the cloth
quickly about it, but not before his eyes had met those of Lord Ronsdale
and caught the amazement, incredulity, sudden terror--was it terror?--in
their depths.</p>

<p>"Told you not to trust him, Jocelyn!" Sir Charles' loud, hearty voice at
the same moment interrupted. "There was a look about him I didn't like from
the beginning."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he needs only a little toning down to be fit," put in Captain
Forsythe, as he and the others drew near. "A few seasons with the hounds,
or--"</p>

<p>"Chasing some poor little fox!" said the girl with light scorn.</p>

<p>"One might be doing something worse!"</p>

<p>"One might!" Her accents were dubious.</p>

<p>"You don't believe in the chase, or the hunt? Allow me to differ; people
always must hunt <i>something</i>, don't you know; primeval instinct! Used
to hunt one another," he laughed. "Sometimes do now. Fox is only a
substitute for the joys of the man-hunt; sort of sop to Cerberus, as it
were. Eh, Ronsdale?"</p>

<p>But the nobleman did not answer; his face <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[pg 122]</span>looked drawn and gray;
with one hand he seemed almost clinging to his saddle. John Steele's back
was turned; he was bending over the girth of his saddle and his features
could not be seen, but the hand, so firm and assured a moment before,
seemed a little uncertain as it made pretext to readjust a fastening or
buckle.</p>

<p>"Why, man, you look ill!" Captain Forsythe, turning to Lord Ronsdale,
exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>"It's--nothing--much--" With vacant expression the nobleman regarded the
speaker; then lifted his hand and pressed it an instant to his breast.
"Heart," he murmured mechanically. "Beastly bad heart, you know, and
sometimes a little thing--slight shock--Miss Wray's danger--"</p>

<p>"Take some of this!" The captain, with solicitude, pressed a flask on
him; the nobleman drank deeply. "There; that'll pick you up."</p>

<p>"Beastly foolish!" A color sprang to Lord Ronsdale's face; he held
himself more erect.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Sir Charles interposed. "A <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[pg 123]</span>man can't help a bad liver
or a bad heart. One of those inscrutable visitations of Providence! But
shall we go on? You're sure you're quite yourself?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" The nobleman's tone was even harder and more metallic than
usual; his thin lips compressed to a tight line; his eyes that looked out
to a great distance were bright and glistening.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Mr. Steele?" Jocelyn Wray waited a moment as the others
started, looked down at that gentleman. Her voice was gracious; its soft
accents seemed to say: "You may ride with me; it is your reward!"</p>

<p>For one restored so quickly to favor, with a felicitous prospect of gay
words and bright glances, John Steele seemed singularly dull and apathetic.
He exhibited no haste in the task he was engaged in; straightened slowly
and mounted with leisure. Once again in the saddle, and on their way, it is
true he appeared to listen to the girl; but his responses were vague,
lacking both in vivacity and humor. It was impossible she should not notice
this want of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[pg
124]</span>attention; she bit her lips once; then she laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Steele, if I were vain I should feel hurt."</p>

<p>"Hurt?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"You haven't heard what I have been saying." Her eyes challenged
his.</p>

<p>"Haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Deny it."</p>

<p>He did not; again she looked at him merrily.</p>

<p>"Of course, I can't afford to be harsh with my rescuer. Perhaps"--in the
same tone--"you really did save my life! Have you ever really saved any
one--any one else, shall I say?--you who are so strong?"</p>

<p>A spasm as of pain passed over his face; his look, however, was not for
her; and the girl's eyes, too, had now become suddenly set afar. Was she
thinking of another scene, some one her own words conjured to mind? Her
mood seemed to gain in seriousness; she also became very quiet; and so
almost in silence they went on to the entrance, down the street, to her
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[pg
125]</span>"<i>Au revoir</i>, and thank you!" she said there, regaining her
accustomed lightness.</p>

<p>"Good-by! At least for the present," he added. "I am leaving London,"
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Leaving?" She regarded him in surprise. "To be gone long?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say. Perhaps."</p>

<p>"But--you must have decided suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"While we have been riding home?" Again he answered affirmatively; the
blue eyes looked at him long. "Is it--is it serious?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Men make so much of business, nowadays," she observed, "it--it always
seems serious, I suppose. We--we are moving into the country in a few
weeks. Shall I--shall we, see you before then?"</p>

<p>"To my regret, I am afraid not."</p>

<p>"And after"--in a voice matter-of-fact--"I think aunt has put you down
for July; a house party; I don't recall the exact dates. You will
come?"</p>

<p>"Shall we say, circumstances permitting--" <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[pg 126]</span>"Certainly," a little
stiffly, "circumstances permitting." She gave him her hand. "<i>Au
revoir!</i> Or good-by, if you prefer it." He held the little gloved
fingers; let them drop. There was a suggestion of hopelessness in the
movement that fitted oddly his inherent vigor and self-poise; she started
to draw away; an ineffable something held her.</p>

<p>"Good luck in your business!" she found herself saying, half-gaily,
half-ironically.</p>

<p>He answered, hoarsely, something--what?--rode off. With color flaming
high, the girl looked after him until Lord Ronsdale's horse, clattering
near, caused her to turn quickly.</p>

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2VI'></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><a name='A_CONFERENCE'></a>A CONFERENCE</h3>


<p>The book-worms' row, hardly a street, more a short-cut passage between
two important thoroughfares, had through the course of many years exercised
a subtle fascination for pedant, pedagogue or itinerant litterateur. At one
end of the way was rush and bustle; at the other, more rush and bustle;
here might be found the comparative hush of the tiny stream that for a
short interval has left the parent current. Dusty and musty shops looked
out on either side, and within on shelves, or without on stands, unexpected
bargains lay carelessly about, rare Horaces or Ovids, Greek tragedies,
ponderous volumes of the golden age of the English poets and philosophers.
Truth nestled in dark corners; knowledge lay hidden in frayed covers and
beauty enshrined herself behind cobwebs.</p>

<p>Not that the thoroughfare, in its entirety, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[pg 128]</span>was devoted to books; nor
that it housed no other people than bibliomaniacs or antiquarians! Higher,
above the little shops, small rooms, reached by rickety stairways, offered
quiet corners for divers and sundry gentlemen whose occupations called for
discreet and retired nooks.</p>

<p>In one of these places, described on the door as "a private,
confidential, inquiry office," sat, on the morning following John Steele's
ride in the park, a little man with ferret-like eyes at a dusty desk near a
dusty window. He did not seem to be very busy, was engaged at the moment in
drawing meaningless cabalistic signs on a piece of paper, when a step in
the hallway and a low tapping at the door caused him to throw down his pen
and straighten expectantly. A client, perhaps!--a woman?--no, a man! With
momentary surprise, he gazed on the delicately chiseled features of his
caller; a gentleman faultlessly dressed and wearing a spring flower in his
coat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gillett?" The visitor's glance veiled an expression of
restlessness; his face, although mask-like, was tinted with a faint
flush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[pg
129]</span>The police agent at once rose. "The same, sir, at your service;
I--but I beg your pardon; unless I am mistaken--haven't we--"</p>

<p>"Yes; a number of years ago on the <i>Lord Nelson</i>," said the caller
in a hard matter-of-fact tone. "We were fellow passengers on her,
until--"</p>

<p>"We became fellow occupants of one of her small boats! An aging
experience! But won't you," with that deference for rank and position those
of his type are pleased to assume, "honor me by being seated, Lord
Ronsdale?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he dusted vigorously with his handkerchief a chair which
his caller, after a moment's hesitation, sank into; Mr. Gillett regarded
the one he himself had been occupying; then, in an apologetic manner
ventured to take it. "Your lordship is well? Your lordship looks it. Your
lordship was, last I heard, in Australia, I believe. A genuine pleasure to
see your lordship once more."</p>

<p>The visitor offered no acknowledgment to this flattering effusion; his
long fingers rubbed one another softly. He looked at the table, the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[pg 130]</span>window,
anywhere save at the proprietor of the establishment, then said: "I saw by
an advertisement in the morning papers that you had severed your connection
with the force and had opened this--a private consultation bureau."</p>

<p>"Quite so!" The other looked momentarily embarrassed. "A little
friction--account of some case--unreliable witness that got tangled
up--They undertook to criticize me, after all my faithful service--" He
broke off. "Besides, the time comes when a man realizes he can do better
for himself by himself. I am now devoting myself to a small, but strictly
high-class," with an accent, "clientele."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale considered; when he spoke, his voice was low, but it did
not caress the ear. "You know John Steele, of course?"</p>

<p>The ferret eyes snapped. "That I do, your Lordship. What of him?"
quickly.</p>

<p>The caller made no reply but tapped the floor lightly with his cane,
and--"What of him?" repeated Mr. Gillett.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale's glance turned; it had a strange brightness. His next
question was irrelevant. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131"
id="Page_131"></a>[pg 131]</span>"Ever think much about the <i>Lord
Nelson,</i> Gillett?"</p>

<p>"She isn't a boat one's apt to forget, after what happened, your
Lordship," was the answer. "And if I do say it, her passengers were of the
kind to leave pleasant recollections," the police agent diplomatically
added.</p>

<p>"Her passengers?" The caller's thin lips compressed; a spark seemed to
leap from his gaze, but not before he had dropped it. "Among them, if
memory serves me, were a number of convicts?"</p>

<p>"A job lot of precious jailbirds that I was acting as escort of, your
Lordship!"</p>

<p>"But who never reached Australia!" quickly.</p>

<p>"Drowned!--every mother's son of them!" observed Mr. Gillett, with a
possible trace of complacency. "Not that I fancy the country they were
going to mourned much about that. I understand a strong sentiment's growing
out there against that sort of immigration."</p>

<p>The visitor's white hand held closer the head of his cane; the stick
bent to his weight. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132"></a>[pg 132]</span>"<i>Were</i> they all drowned, by the
way?" he observed as if seeking casual information on some subject that had
partly passed from his mind.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. They were not released until the second boat got off,
and then there was no time to get overboard the life rafts!"</p>

<p>"True." Lord Ronsdale gazed absently out of the window, through a film,
as it were, at a venerable figure below; one of the species <i>helluo
librorum</i> standing before a book-stall opposite. "Recall the day on that
memorable voyage you were telling us about them--who they were, and so
on?"</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Mr. Gillett, good-humoredly. If his caller cared to
discuss generalities rather than come at once to the business at hand,
whatever had brought him there, that was none of his concern. These titled
gentry had a leisurely method, peculiar to themselves, of broaching a
subject; but if they paid him well for his time he could afford to appear
an amiable and interested listener. In this case, the thought also
insinuated itself, that his visitor had something of the manner of a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[pg
133]</span>who had been up late the night before; the glint of his eye was
that of your fashionable gamester; Mr. Gillett smiled sympathetically.</p>

<p>"One, if I recall rightly," went on Lord Ronsdale, "was known as--let me
see"--the elastic stick described a sharper curve--"the 'Frisco Pet?
Remember?" He bent slightly nearer.</p>

<p>"That I do. Not likely to forget him. Unmanageable; one of the worst!
Was transported for life, with death as a penalty for returning." A slight
sound came from the nobleman's throat. "A needless precaution," laughed the
speaker, "for he's gone to his reward. And so your lordship
remembers--"</p>

<p>"I remember when he used to step into the ring," said Lord Ronsdale, his
voice rising somewhat. "Truth is, sight of you brought back old
recollections. Things I haven't thought of for a long time, don't you
see!"</p>

<p>"Quite so! Delighted, I am sure. I didn't know so much about him then;
that came after; except that the gentlemen found him a figure worth looking
at when he got up at the post--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[pg
134]</span>"Yes; he was worth looking at." Lord Bonsdale's eyes half
closed. "A heavy-fisted, shapely brute; with muscles like steel. But
ignorant--" He lingered on the word; then his glance suddenly lifted--"Had
something on his arm; recall noticing it while the bout was on!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett with a knowing expression rose, took a volume from a
bookcase and opened it.</p>

<p>"The 'something' you speak of, my Lord," he observed proudly, "should be
here; I will show it that you may appreciate my system; the method I have
of gathering and tabulating data. You will find an encyclopedia of
information in that bookcase. All that Scotland Yard has, and perhaps a
little besides."</p>

<p>"Really?" The nobleman's eyes fastened themselves on the book.</p>

<p>"To illustrate: Here's his case." Gillett's fingers moved lightly over
the page. "'Testimony of Dandy Joe, down-stairs at the time with landlady
who kept the house where the crime was committed. Heard 'Frisco Pet, who
had been drinking, come in; go up-stairs, as <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[pg 135]</span>they supposed, to his own
room; shortly after, loud voices; pistol shot. Landlady and Joe found
woman, Amy Gerard, dead in shabby little sitting-room. Pet, the worse for
liquor, in a dazed condition at a table, head in his hands. Testimony of
Joe corroborated by landlady; she swore no one had been in house except
parties here mentioned, all lodgers.</p>

<p>"'Private mem.--House in bad neighborhood, near the Adelphi catacombs.
Son of landlady, red-headed giant, also one-time prize-fighter, used to
live here; the Pet's last fight in the ring was with him. Later Tom took to
the road; was wanted by the police at the time of the crime for some brutal
highway work--' But," breaking off, "I am wearying your lordship. Here is
what I was especially looking for, the markings on the arm of the 'Frisco
Pet. Perhaps, however, your lordship doesn't care to listen further--"</p>

<p>"Go on!" The words broke sharply from the visitor's lips; then he gave a
metallic laugh. "I am interested in this wonderful system of yours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[pg
136]</span>Mr. Gillett read slowly: "'On the right arm of the 'Frisco Pet,
just below the elbow, appears the figure of a man, in sparring attitude,
done in sailor's tattooing; about the waist a flag, the stars and stripes
in their accustomed colors; crudely drawn but not to be mistaken by noting
following defects and details--' which," closing the book, "I won't
read."</p>

<p>His lordship's head had turned; at first he did not speak. "A good
system," he remarked after an interval. "And a very good description, and
yet--" His voice died away; for a moment he sat motionless. "But my
purpose--the purpose of my visit--I--we have wandered quite from that. Let
us, I beg of you, talk business."</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett started as if to venture a mild expostulation, but thought
better of the impulse. "What <i>is</i> your lordship's business with me?"
he observed in his most professional tone.</p>

<p>"I believe"--the visitor moistened his lips--"I believe I
mentioned--John Steele when I came in?"</p>

<p>"Your lordship did."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[pg
137]</span>"It--concerns him."</p>

<p>"I am all attention, your Lordship." Mr. Gillett's manner was keen,
energetic; if he felt surprise he suppressed it. "Good! your lordship's
business concerns John Steele."</p>

<p>"For reasons that need not be mentioned, I want to find out all I can
about him. That, I believe, is the sort of work you undertake. The terms
for your services can be arranged later. It is unnecessary to say you will
be well paid. I assume you can command competent and trustworthy help, that
you have agents, perhaps, in other countries?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett nodded. "If your lordship would give me some idea of the
scope of the inquiry--"</p>

<p>The long fingers opened, then closed tightly.</p>

<p>"In the first place, you are to ascertain where John Steele was before
he came to England; how he got there; what he did. Naturally, if he has
lived in a far-away port you would seek to know the ship that brought him
there; the names of the captain and the crew."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[pg
138]</span>"Your lordship thinks, then, our investigation may lead us to
distant lands?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" The nobleman's voice was sharp, querulous. "That is what
you are to find out."</p>

<p>"It shall be done, your Lordship," replied the other quickly. "I shall
embark in the matter with great zest, and, I may add, interest."</p>

<p>"Interest?" The nobleman looked at him. "Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"If I might be so bold, may I ask, does your lordship expect to find
anything that would--ahem!--cast any reflection on the high standing John
Steele is building up for himself in the community, or---"</p>


<p>A shadow seemed to darken the mask-like features of the visitor; his
gaze at once glittering, vaguely questioning, was fastened on the wall;
then slowly, without answering, he got up. "Surmises are not to enter into
this matter," he said shortly. "It is facts, I want--facts!"</p>

<p>"And your lordship shall have them. The case appears simple; not hard to
get at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[pg
139]</span>bottom of!" An odd expression shone from the visitor's eyes.
"Which reminds me he has left town," added Gillett.</p>

<p>"Left town!" Lord Ronsdale wheeled abruptly. "You mean--"</p>

<p>"For a little trip to the continent I should imagine; heard of it
because he got some unimportant court matter put over."</p>

<p>"Gone away!" The nobleman, his back to the other, lifted a hand to his
brow. "When?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"It was only yesterday morning I was riding with him!"</p>

<p>"And he didn't mention the matter?"</p>

<p>The visitor did not answer. "Why should he have gone away?" he murmured,
half aloud. "Was it because--" He walked to the door; at the threshold
stopped and looked back. "You might begin your inquiry by learning all you
can about this little trip," he suggested. "And by the by, whatever you may
find out, if anything, you will regard as belonging to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[pg 140]</span>me
exclusively; to be mentioned, under no circumstances, without my
permission, to any one whosoever--"</p>

<p>"Your lordship!" Mr. Gillett's hurt voice implied the little need for
such admonition. "In my profession absolute integrity toward one's client
demands that secrecy should be the first con--"</p>

<p>"It is understood then. Let me hear from you from time to time," and the
nobleman went out.</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett looked after him, then, reflectively, at the closed door.
Outside the sound of shuffling feet alone broke the stillness; before the
book-stand the bibliomaniac buried his face deeper in the musty pages of an
old tragedy.</p>

<h3><a name='INCIDENTS'></a>INCIDENTS</h3>


<p>Several months went by and John Steele saw nothing further, although he
heard often, of Miss Jocelyn Wray. His business to the continent, whatever
its nature, had seemed sufficiently important to authorize from him to her,
in due process of time, a short perfunctory message regretting his
inability to present himself at the appointed hour at Strathorn House.
Whether the young girl found in the letter a vagueness warranting a
suspicion that John Steele preferred the heavy duties of the city to the
light frivolities of the country matters not; suffice it the weeks passed
and no further invitations, in the ponderous script of the wife of Sir
Charles, arrived to tempt him from his accustomed ways. But the days of
this long interim had not passed altogether uneventfully; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[pg 142]</span>a few
incidents, apart from the routine of his work, obtruded themselves upon his
attention.</p>

<p>A number of supposedly prospective clients had called to ask for him at
his office during his sojourn on the other side of the channel. That was to
have been expected; but one or two of these, by dint of flattery, or
possibly silver-lined persuasion, had succeeded in gaining access to his
chambers.</p>

<p>"I should like to have a look into John Steele's library; I've heard
it's worth while," one had observed to the butler at the door. "Only a bit
of a peep around!" His manner of putting his desire, supplemented by a
half-crown, left the butler no alternative save to comply with the request,
until the "peep around" began to develop into more than cursory
examination, when his sense of propriety became outraged and the visitor's
welcome was cut short.</p>

<p>"He was that curious, a regular Paul Pry!" explained the servant to John
Steele, in narrating the incident on the latter's return to London. "Seemed
specially taken by the reports <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143"
id="Page_143"></a>[pg 143]</span>of the old trials you have on the shelves,
sir. 'What an interesting collection of <i>causes
c&eacute;l&egrave;bres!</i>' he kept remarking. 'I suppose your master
makes much of them?' He would have been handling of them, too, and when I
showed him the door--trusting I did right, sir, even if he should happen to
be a client!--he asked more questions before going."</p>

<p>"What questions?" quietly.</p>

<p>"Personal-like. But I put a stop to that."</p>

<p>For a few moments John Steele said nothing; his face, on his
reappearance in London, had looked slightly paler, more set and determined,
not unlike that of a man, who, strongly assailed, has made up his mind to
do battle to the end. With whom? How many? He might put out his hand,
clench it; the thin air made no answer. He regarded the shadows now; they
seemed to wave around him, intangible, obscure. A dark day in town, the
streets were oppressive; the people below passed like poorly done replicas
of themselves; the rattle of the wheels resembled a sullen, disgruntled
mumble.</p>

<p>"You will admit no one to my chambers <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[pg 144]</span>during my absence in the
future," said Steele at length, to the man, sternly. "No one, you
understand, under any pretext whatever; even," a flicker of grim humor in
the deep eyes, "if he should say he was a client of mine!"</p>

<p>The butler returned a subdued answer, and John Steele, after a moment's
thought, stepped to a large safe in the corner, and applying a somewhat
elaborate combination, swung open the door. Taking from a compartment a
bundle of papers carefully rolled, he unfastened the tape, spread them on a
table and examined them, one after the other. They made a voluminous heap;
here and there on the white pages in bold regular script appeared the name
of a woman; her life lay before him, the various stages of an odd and
erratic career. At a cabaret at Montmartre; at a casino in the Paris
Bohemian quarter; in London--at a variety hall of amusement. And
afterward!--wastrel, nomad! Throughout the writing, in many of the
documents, another name, too, a titled name, a man's, often came and went,
flitted elusively from leaf to leaf.</p>

name of a woman Page 144</p>

<p>The reader looked at this name, wrote a page or two, and inserted them.
But his task seemed to afford him little satisfaction; his face wore an
expression not remote from discouragement; none knew better than he the
actual value, for his purpose, of the material before him. The chaff,
froth, bubble of the case!--almost contemptuously he regarded it. Had he
sought the unattainable? Certainly he had left no stone unturned, no stone,
and yet the head and front of what he sought had ever escaped him--should
he ever grasp it?--with these new secret activities menacing
him?--harassing the future?</p>

<p>He drew himself up suddenly, as if to shake off momentary doubt or
depression. Replacing his documents in the safe and locking it, he walked
into a room adjoining; in a bare, square place on the wall hung foils and
broadswords, and the only furnishings were the conventional appointments of
a home gymnasium.</p>

<p>Here, having doffed his street clothes and assumed the scant costume of
the athlete, for an hour or more he exercised vigorously, every muscle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[pg
146]</span>responding to its task with an untiring ease that told of a
perfect system of training. As he stood in the glow, breathing deep and
full, his figure, with its perfect lines of strength and litheness, the
superb but not too pronounced swell of limb and shoulder, would have been
the delight of the professional expounder of dumb-bells, bars and clubs, as
the most proper medium of "fitness" and condition. Whether he exercised for
the sake of exercising, or because bodily movement served to stimulate his
mind in the consideration of problems of moment, John Steele certainly had
never been in finer physical fettle than at this particular period of his
varied and eventful career. Which proved of service to him and his
well-being, for one night, not long thereafter, he was called upon to
defend himself from a number of footpads who set upon him.</p>

<p>The episode occurred in his own street near a corner, where the shadows
were black at an hour when the narrow way seemed silent and deserted. For a
block or more footfalls had sounded behind him, now quickening, then
becoming <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[pg
147]</span>more deliberate, in unison with his own steps, as from time to
time he purposely altered his pace. Once he had stopped; whereupon they too
had paused. A moment he stood looking up at St. Paul's, immense, ominous,
casting at that late hour a dim patch of shadow over scores of pigmy
buildings and paltry byways; when he went on, patter!--patter!--the
trailing of feet, inevitable as fate, followed through the darkness. But
they came no nearer until, abruptly wheeling, he entered the short street
where his chambers were located; at the same time two men, apparently
sauntering from the river in that side thoroughfare, approached him
somewhat rapidly, separating slightly as they did so.</p>

<p>John Steele seemed oblivious. He moved into a doorway and drawing from
his pocket a cigar, unconcernedly lighted a match. The fellows looked at
him, at the tiny flame; it flickered and went out. They hesitated; he felt
in his pocket, giving them time to move by. They did not do so; in a moment
the others from the main highway would join <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[pg 148]</span>them. As if disappointed
in not finding what he sought, Steele, looking around, appeared to see for
the first time the evil-looking miscreants who had came from the direction
of the Thames, and striding toward them asked bruskly for a light. One of
the fellows thus unceremoniously addressed had actually begun to feel in
his shabby garments for the article required when his companion uttered a
short derisory oath.</p>

<p>It served as a sudden stimulus to him against whom it was directed; the
old precept that he who strikes first strikes best, John Steele seemed
fully to appreciate. His heavy stick flashed in the air, rang hard; the way
before him cleared, he did not linger. But close behind now the others came
fast; his door, however, was near. Now he reached it, fitted the heavy key.
Had it turned as usual, the episode would have been brought to a speedy
conclusion, but, as it was, the key stuck. The foremost of those who had
been trailing fell upon Steele but soon drew back; one of them, unable to
repress a groan, held his hand to a broken wrist, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[pg 149]</span>while from his helpless
fingers a knife dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>A hoarse voice in thieves' jargon, unintelligible to the layman, cursed
them for cowards; John Steele on a sudden laughed loudly, exultantly;
whereupon he who had thus spoken from the background stared. A ponderous,
hulking fellow, about six feet three, with a shock of red hair and a thick
hanging lip,--obviously this one of his assailants possessed immense,
unusual strength. In appearance he was the reverse of pleasing; his
bloodshot eyes seemed to shine like coals from the darkness, the huge body
to quiver with rage or with lust for the conflict.</p>

<p>"Let me at him, ye--!" he cried in foul and flash tongue, when John
Steele suddenly called him by name, said something in that selfsame dialect
of pickpurses and their ilk.</p>

<p>Whatever the words or their portent, the effect was startling. Steele's
bulky assailant paused, remained stock-still, his purpose arrested, all his
anger gone out of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[pg
150]</span>"How the--? Who--?" the man began.</p>

<p>"Call off your fellows!" John Steele's voice seemed to thrill; a fierce
elation shone from his glance. "I want to talk with you. It'll be more
worth your while than any prigging or bagging you've ever yet done."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" The man's tone was puzzled; surprise, suspicion
gleamed from the bloodshot eyes. "How should a swell gent like you know--?
And you want to talk with me? Here's a gamey cove!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I must talk with you! And it will be better for you, my
man--" a sharp metallic click told that the speaker had turned the key in
the lock behind him--"to step in here with me. You needn't be afraid I'm
going to nab you; I've got a lay better than hooking you for the dock. As
for the others, they can go, for all of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, they can!" The big man's face expressed varying feelings--vague
wonder; at the same time he began to edge cautiously away. "That would be a
nice plant, wouldn't it? <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151"></a>[pg 151]</span>Let's out of this, blokies!" suddenly,
"this cove knows too much, and--"</p>

<p>"Wait!" Steele stepped slightly toward him. "I want you, Tom Rogers, and
I'm going to have you; it'll be quids in your pocket and not Newgate."</p>

<p>"Slope for it, mates!" The big man's voice rang out; around the corner
in the direction of the Thames the burly figure of a policeman appeared in
the dim light. "That's his little game!" and turned.</p>

<p>But John Steele sprang savagely forward. "You fool! You'll not get away
so easily!" he exclaimed, when one of the others put out a foot. It caught
the pursuing man fairly and tripped him. John Steele went down hard; his
head struck the stone curb violently.</p>

<p>For some moments he lay still; when at length he did move, to lift
himself on his elbow, as through a mist he made out the broad and
solicitous face of a policeman bending over him.</p>

<p>"That was a nasty fall you got, sir."</p>

<p>"Fall?" John Steele arose, stood swaying. "That man!--must not
escape--Do you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152"></a>[pg 152]</span>hear? must not!" As he spoke he made as if
to rush forward; the other laid steadying fingers on his arm.</p>

<p>"Hold hard a bit, sir," he said. "Not quite yourself; besides, they're
well out of sight now. No use running after."</p>

<p>Steele moved, grasped the railing leading up the front step; his brow
throbbed; a thousand darting pains shot through his brain. But for the
moment these physical pangs were as nothing; disappointment, self-reproach
moved him. To have allowed himself to go down like that; to have been
caught by such a simple trick! Clumsy clod!--and at a moment when--He
laughed fiercely; from his head the blood flowed; he did not feel that hurt
now.</p>

<p>The officer regarded the strong, noble figure moving just a little to
and fro, the lips set ironically, the dark eyes that gleamed in the night
as with sardonic derision.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," he said in a brisker tone, "but hadn't we better go
in? This, I take it, is your house; you can look after yourself somewhat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[pg
153]</span>and afterward describe your assailants. Then we'll start out to
find and arrest them, if possible!"</p>

<p>"Arrest?" John Steele looked at the officer; his gaze slowly regained
its accustomed steadiness. "I am afraid I can't help you; the darkness, the
suddenness of the attack--"</p>

<p>"But surely you must have noticed something, sir; whether they were
large, or small; what sort of clothes they wore--" The other shook his
head; the man appeared disappointed. "Well, I'll make a report of the
attack, but--"</p>

<p>Steele loosened his hold on the railing; he appeared now to have
recovered his strength. "That's just what I don't want you to do. My name
is John Steele, you know of me?" And, as the other returned a respectful
affirmative, "It is my desire to escape any notoriety in this little
matter, you understand? As one whose profession brings him in connection
with these people, the episode seems rather anomalous as well as
humiliating. It might even," his accents had a covert mocking sound,
"furnish a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[pg
154]</span>paragraph for one of the comic weeklies. So you see--" Something
passed from his hand to the policeman's.</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that, sir; but I suppose there is something in your
way of looking at it, and as there isn't much chance of getting them,
anyhow, without any clue, or description--" his voice died away.</p>

<p>Walking quickly up the steps John Steele opened the door, murmured a
perfunctory "Good night" and let himself in. But as he mounted to his
chambers, some of the moment's exultation that had seized him at sight of
the man, revived.</p>

<p>"He has come back--he is here--in London. I surely can lay hands on
him--I must! I will!"</p>

<h3><a name='A_CHANGE_OF_FRONT'></a>A CHANGE OF FRONT</h3>


<p>HE found the task no easy one, however, although he went at it with his
characteristic vigor and energy. Few men knew the seamy side of London
better than John Steele: its darksome streets and foul alleys, its hovels
and various habitations. And this knowledge he utilized to the best
advantage, always to find that his efforts came to naught. The snares he
set before possible hiding-places proved abortive; the artifices he
employed to uncover the quarry in maze or labyrinth were fruitless. The man
had appeared like a vision from the past, and vanished. Whither? Out of the
country, once more? Over the seas? Had he taken quick alarm at Steele's
words, and effected a hasty retreat from the scenes of his graceless and
nefarious career?</p>

<p>Reluctantly John Steele found himself forced <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[pg 156]</span>to entertain the
possibility of this being so; otherwise the facilities at his command were
such that he should most likely, ere this, have been able to attain his
end, find what he sought. Soberly attired, he attracted no very marked
attention in the slums,--breeding spots of the criminal classes; the
denizens knew John Steele; he had been there oft before.</p>

<p>He had, on occasion, assisted some of them with stern good advice or
more substantial services. He was acquainted with these men and women; had,
perhaps, a larger charity for them than most people find it expedient to
cherish. His glance had always seemed to read them through and through,
with uncompromising realization of their infirmities, weaknesses of the
flesh and inherited moral imperfections. His very fearlessness had ever
commended him to that lower world; it did now, enabling him the better to
cast about in divers directions.</p>

<p>To hear nothing, to learn nothing, at least, very little! One man had
seen the object of Steele's solicitude and to this person, a weazened
little "undesirable," the red-headed giant had <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[pg 157]</span>confided that London was
pretty hot and he thought of decamping from it.</p>

<p>"'Arter all this time that's gone by,' he says to me, bitter-like, 'to
think a man can't come back to 'is native 'ome without being spied on for
what ought long ago to be dead and forgot!' But you're not trying to lay
hands on 'im, to put 'im in the pen, gov'ner?"</p>

<p>"I?" A singular glint shot from Steele's gaze. "No, no, my man, I'm not
seeking him for that. But he didn't say where he expected to go?"</p>

<p>"Not he."</p>

<p>"Nor what had brought him to London?"</p>

<p>"I expect it was 'omesickness, sir. 'E's been a bad lot, but 'e has a
heart, arter all. It was to see 'is mother 'e came back; the old woman drew
'im 'ere. You see 'e had written 'er from foreign parts, but could never
'ear; 'cause she had moved; used to keep a place where a woman was
found--"</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>"Murdered!" said the man; John Steele was silent. "And she, 'is mother
'ad gone, 'aving <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158"
id="Page_158"></a>[pg 158]</span>saved a bit, out into a peaceable-like
little 'amlet, where there weren't no bobbies, only instead, bits of flower
gardens and bright bloomin' daffy-down-dillies. But, blime me, when Tom
come and found out where she 'ad changed to, if she 'adn't gone and
shuffled off, and all 'e 'ad for 'is pains was the sight of a mound in the
churchyard."</p>

<p>"Yes; she's buried," said John Steele thoughtfully, "and all she might
have told about the woman who was--murdered, is buried with her."</p>

<p>"But she did tell, sir; at the time," quickly, "of the trial."</p>

<p>"True." The visitor's tone changed. "If you can find Tom, give him this
note; you'll be well paid--"</p>

<p>"I ain't askin' for that; you got me off easy once and gave me a lift,
arter I was let out--"</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Steele made a brusk gesture. "We all need a helping hand
sometimes," he said turning away.</p>

<p>And that was as near as he had come to attainment of his desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[pg
159]</span>Summer passed; sometimes, the better to think, to plan, to keep
himself girded by constant exercise, he repaired to the park, now neglected
by fashion and given over to that nebulous quantity of diverse qualities
called the people. Where fine gentlemen and beaux had idled, middle-class
nurse-maids now trundled their charges or paused to converse with the
stately guardians of the place. Almost deserted were roads and row; landau,
victoria and brougham, with their varied coats-of-arms, no longer rolled
pompously past; only the occasional democratic cab, of nimble
possibilities, speeding by with a fare lent pretext of life to the scene.
True, the nomad appeared in ever increasing numbers, holding his right to
the sward for a couch as an inalienable privilege; John Steele encountered
him on every hand. Once, beneath a great tree, where Jocelyn Wray and he
had stopped their horses to talk for a moment, the bleared, bloated face of
what had been a man looked up at him. The sight for an instant seemed to
startle the beholder; a wave of anger at that face, set in a place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[pg
160]</span>imagination had an instant before played with a picture
altogether different, passed over him; then quickly went.</p>

<p>As he strode forward at a swinging pace, his thoughts swept swiftly
again into another channel, one they had been flowing in when he had first
entered the park that day. Above him the leaves rustled ceaselessly; their
restless movements seemed in keeping with his mood wherein impatience
mingled with other and fiercer emotions. Fate had been against him, the
inevitable "what must be," which, in the end, crushes alike Faintheart or
Strongheart. Of what avail to square his shoulders? the danger pressed
close; he felt it, by that intuition men sometimes have. What if he left,
left the field, this England? Who could accuse him of cowardice if in that
black moment he yielded to the hateful course and went, like the guilty,
pitiable skulkers?</p>

<p>"How do you do, Steele? Just the man I wanted to see!"</p>

<p>Near the main exit, toward which John Steele had unconsciously stepped,
the sound of a familiar <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161"></a>[pg 161]</span>voice and the appearance of a well-known
stocky form broke in, with startling abruptness, on the dark train of
thought.</p>

<p>"Deep in some point of law?" went on Sir Charles. "'Pon honor, believe
you would have cut me. However, don't apologize; you're forgiven!"</p>

<p>"Most amiable of you to say so, Sir Charles!" perfunctorily.</p>

<p>"Not at all! Especially as our meeting is quite apropos. Obliged to run
up to town on a little matter of business; but, thank goodness, it's done.
Never saw London more deserted. Dined at the club, nobody there. Supped at
the hotel, dining-room empty. Strolled up Piccadilly, not a soul to be
seen. That is," he added, "no one whom one has seen before, which is the
same thing. But how did you enjoy your trip to the continent?"</p>

<p>"It was not exactly a trip for pleasure," returned the other with a
slight accent of constraint.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; so I understood. But fancy going to the continent on business!
One usually <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[pg
162]</span>goes for--which reminds me, how would you like to go back into
the country with me?"</p>

<p>"I? It is impossible at the moment for--"</p>

<p>But Sir Charles seemed not to listen. "Deuced dull journey for a man to
take alone; good deal of it by coach. You'll find a few salmon to
kill--trout and all that. Think of the joy of whipping a stream, after
having been mewed up all these months in the musty metropolis! Besides, I
made a wager with Jocelyn you wouldn't refuse a second opportunity to bask
in Arcadia." He laughed. "'I really couldn't presume to ask him again,' is
the way she expressed it, 'but if you can draw a sufficiently eloquent
picture of the rural attractions of Strathorn to woo him from his beloved
dusty byways, you have my permission to try.'"</p>

<p>"Did she say that?" John Steele spoke quickly. Then, "I am sorry, it is
impossible, but," in a low tone, "how is Miss Wray?"</p>

<p>"Never better. Enjoying every moment. Jolly party and all that. Lord
Ronsdale and--" Here Sir Charles enumerated a number of people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[pg
163]</span>"Lord Ronsdale is there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; couldn't keep him away from Strathorn House now," he laughed. "As
a matter of fact he has asked my permission to--there!" Sir Charles
stopped, then laughed again with a little embarrassment. "I've nearly let
the cat out of the bag."</p>

<p>John Steele spoke no word; his face was set, immovable; his lashes
shaded his eyes. A flood of traffic at a corner held them; he appeared
attentive only for it. The wheels pounded and rattled; the whips snapped
and cracked.</p>

<p>"You mean he has proposed for her hand and she--" Steele seemed to speak
with difficulty--"has consented?"</p>

<p>The noise almost drowned the question but Sir Charles heard.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. She appears complaisant, as it were," he answered.
"But really, I shouldn't have mentioned the matter at all; quite premature,
you understand. Let's say no more about it. And--what was it you said about
going back with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John Steele with a sudden <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[pg 164]</span>strength and energy that
Sir Charles might attribute to the desire to make himself understood above
the din of the street. "I'll go back with you at"--the latter words, lower
spoken, the other did not catch--"no matter what cost!"</p>

<p>Sir Charles dodged a vehicle; he did not observe the light, the fire,
the sudden play of fierce, dark passion on his companion's face.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "And when you get tired of 'books in the running
brooks'--"</p>

<p>Steele's hand closed on his arm. "When do you leave?" he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"To-day--to-morrow--Suit your convenience."</p>

<p>"Let it be to-day, then! To-day!"</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked at him quickly; John Steele's face recovered its
composure.</p>

<p>"I believe I have become weary of what your niece calls the 'dusty
byways,'" he explained with a forced laugh.</p>

<h3><a name='AWAY_FROM_THE_TOWN'></a>AWAY FROM THE TOWN</h3>


<p>When John Steele, contrary to custom, set aside, in deciding to leave
London that day, all logical methods of reasoning and acted on what was
nothing more than an irresistible impulse, he did not attempt to belittle
to himself the possible consequences that might accrue from his action. He
was not following the course intelligence had directed; he was not
embarking on a journey his best interests would have prompted; on the
contrary, he knew himself mad, foolish. But not for one moment did he
regret his decision; stubbornly, obstinately he set his back toward the
town; with an enigmatical gleam in his dark eyes he looked away from the
blur Sir Charles and he had left behind them.</p>

<p>Green pastures, bright prospects! Whence were they leading him? His gaze
was now <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[pg
166]</span>somber, then bright; though more often shadows passed over his
face, like clouds in the sky.</p>

<p>Outwardly his manner had become unconcerned, collected; he listened to
Sir Charles' jokes, offered casual comments of his own. He even performed
his wonted part in relieving the tedium of a long journey with voluntary
contributions to conversations on divers topics in which he displayed wide
and far-reaching knowledge. He answered the many questions of his companion
on the different habits of criminals; how they lived; the possibilities for
reforming the worst of the lot; the various methods toward this end
advocated by the idealist. These and other subjects he touched on with
poignant, illuminating comment.</p>

<p>Sir Charles regarded him once or twice in surprise. "You have seen a
deal in your day," he observed, "of the under world, I mean!" John Steele
returned an evasive answer. The nobleman showed a tendency to doze in his
seat, despite the jolts and jars of the way, and, thereafter, until they
arrived at Strathorn the two fellow travelers rode on in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[pg
167]</span>This little hamlet lay in a sleepy-looking dell; as the driver
swung down a hill he whipped up his horses and literally charged upon the
town; swept through the main thoroughfare and drew up with a flourish
before the principal tavern. Sir Charles started, stretched his legs; John
Steele got down.</p>

<p>"Conveyance of any kind here, waiting to take us to Strathorn House?"
called out the former as he stiffly descended the ladder at the side of the
coach.</p>

<p>The landlord of the Golden Lion, who had emerged from his door, returned
an affirmative reply and at the same time ushered the travelers into a tiny
private sitting-room. As they crossed the hall, turning to the right to
enter this apartment, some one in the room opposite, a more public place,
who had been furtively peering through the half-opened door to observe the
new-comers, at sight of John Steele drew quickly back. Not, however, before
that gentleman had caught a glimpse of him. A strange face, indeed,--but
the fellow's manner--his expression--the act itself somehow struck the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[pg
168]</span>observer,--unduly, no doubt, and yet--A moment later this door
closed, and from beyond came only a murmur of men's voices over pots.</p>

<p>"Trap will be in front directly, Sir Charles," said the landlord
lingering. "Meanwhile if there is anything--"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you! Only a short distance to Strathorn House," he
explained to John Steele, "and I fancy we'll do better by waiting for what
we may require there. But what is the latest news at Strathorn? Anything
happened? Business quiet?"</p>

<p>"It 'asn't been so brisk, and it 'asn't been so dull, your Lordship,
what with now and then a gentleman from London!"</p>

<p>"From London? Isn't that rather unusual?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat. But as for your lordship's first question, I don't know of
any news, except Squire Thompson told me to inform your lordship he would
have the three hunters he was telling your lordship about, down at his stud
farm this afternoon, and if your lordship cared to have a look at
them--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[pg
169]</span>"If?" cried Sir Charles. "There isn't any 'if.' Three finer
animals man never threw leg over, judging from report," he explained to
John Steele. "Stud farm's about a mile in the opposite direction from
Strathorn House. Mind a little jog to the farm first?"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" John Steele had been looking thoughtfully toward the door
that had closed upon the man whose quick regard he had detected. "Only, if
you will allow me to make a counter proposal,--Strathorn House, you say, is
near; I am in the mood for exercise, after sitting so long, and should like
to walk there."</p>

<p>"By all means," returned the other, "since it's your preference. Pretty
apt to overtake you," he went on, after giving his guest a few directions.
"Especially if you linger over any points of interest!"</p>

<p>The trap drew up; the two men separated. Sir Charles rattled briskly
down one way, Steele turned to go the other. But before setting out, he
asked a casual question or two of the landlord, relating to the occasional
"gentleman from London"; the host, however, appeared to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[pg 170]</span>know
little of any cosmopolitan visitors who had happened to drift that way, and
John Steele, eliciting no information in this regard, finally started on
his walk. Whatever his thoughts, many quaint and characteristic bits of the
town failed to divert them; he looked neither to the right, at a James I.
sun-dial; nor to the left, where a small sign proclaimed that an event of
historical importance had made noteworthy that particular spot. Over the
cobblestones, smoothed by the feet of many generations, he walked with eyes
bent straight before him until he reached an open space on the other side
of the village, where he paused. On either side hedges partly screened
undulating meadows, the broad sweeps of emerald green interspersed here and
there with small groups of trees in whose shadows cattle grazed. A stream
with lively murmur meandered downward; in a bush, at his approach, a bird
began to sing, and involuntarily the man stopped; but only for a moment.
Soon rose before him the top of a modest steeple; then a church, within the
sanctuary of whose yard old stones mingled with new. He <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[pg 171]</span>stepped
in; "straight on across the churchyard!" had been Sir Charles' direction.
John Steele moved quickly down the narrow path; his eye had but time to
linger a moment on the monuments, ancient and crumbling, and on headstones
more recently fashioned, when above, another picture caught and held his
attention.</p>

<p>Strathorn House! A noble dwelling, massive, gray! And yet one that
lifted itself with charming lightness from its solid, baronial-like
foundation! It adorned the spot, merged into the landscape. Behind, the
forest, a dark line, penciled itself against the blue horizon; before the
ancient stone pile lay a park. Noble trees guarded the walks, threw over
them great gnarled limbs or delicately-trailing branches. Between, the
interspaces glowed bright with flowers; amid all, a little lake shone like
a silver shield bearing at its center a marble pavilion.</p>

<p>Long the man looked; through a faint veil of mist, turret and tower
quivered; strong lines of masonry vibrated. Wavering as in the spell of an
optical illusion, the structure might have seemed but a figment of
imagination, or one of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172"
id="Page_172"></a>[pg 172]</span>those fanciful castles sung by the
Elizabethan brotherhood of poets. Did the image occur to John Steele, did
he feel for the time, despite other disquieting, extraneous thoughts, the
subtle enchantment of the scene? The minutes passed; he did not move.</p>

<p>"You find it to your liking?"</p>

<p>A voice, fresh, gay, interrupted; with a great start, he turned.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Wray, for it was she, laughed; so absorbed had he been, he had
not heard her light footstep on the grass behind.</p>

<p>"You find it to your liking?" she repeated, tilting quizzically her fair
head.</p>

<p>His face changing, "Entirely!" he managed to say. And then, "I--did not
know you were near."</p>

<p>"No? But I could see that. Confess," with accent a little derisory, "I
startled you." As she spoke she leaned slightly back against the low stone
wall of the churchyard; the shifting light through the leaves played over
her; her eyes seemed to dance in consonance with that movement.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[pg 173]</span>


<p class="figure"><a name="half003" href="images/half003.png"><img
width="40%" alt="Illustration: One would have sworn there was joy in her
voice Page 173" src="images/half003.png" /></a><br />One would have sworn
there was joy in her voice Page 173</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he confessed.</p>

<p>The girl laughed again; one would have sworn there was; oy in her voice.
"You must have been much absorbed," she continued, "in the view!"</p>

<p>"It is very fine." He saw now more clearly the picture she made: the
details of her dress, the slender figure, closely sheathed in a garb of
blue lighter in shade than her eyes.</p>

<p>She put out her hand. "I am forgetting--you came down with my uncle, I
suppose?" in a matter-of-fact tone. "A pleasure we hardly expected! Let me
see. I haven't seen you since--ah, when was it?"</p>

<p>He told her. "Yes; I remember now. Wasn't that the day the Scotch
bagpipes went by? You had business that called you away. Something very
important, was it not? You were successful?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"How oddly you say that!" She looked at him curiously. "But shall we
walk on toward the house? I went down into the town thinking to meet my
uncle," she explained, "but as I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174"
id="Page_174"></a>[pg 174]</span>had a few errands, on account of a
children's f&ecirc;te we are planning, reached the tavern after he had
gone."</p>

<p>"He went to a farm not far distant."</p>

<p>As he spoke, she stepped into the path leading from the churchyard; it
was narrow and she walked before him.</p>

<p>"Yes; so the landlord said," she remarked without looking around. And
then, irrelevantly, "The others went hunting. Are you a Nimrod, Mr.
Steele?"</p>

<p>"Not a mighty one."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't have to be that--for rabbits!"</p>

<p>She shot a glance over her shoulder; her eyes were glad; but to the man
they were bright merely with the joy of youth that drops glances like
sunshine for all alike. Perhaps he would have found pleasure in thinking
she appeared gayer for sight of him; but if the thought came, bitterly,
peremptorily it was dismissed. Sir Charles' words rang through his mind;
Lord Ronsdale!--John Steele's hat shaded his eyes; he stopped to pick a
small flower from the hedge. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
id="Page_175"></a>[pg 175]</span>When he looked up he saw her face no
longer; only the golden hair seemed to flash in his eyes, the beautiful,
bright meshes, and the light, slender figure, so graceful, so buoyant, so
near he could almost touch it, but moving away, moving from him--</p>

<p>It may be, amid other thoughts, at that moment, he asked himself why he
had come. What had driven him to this folly? Why was he stepping on
blindly, oblivious of definite plan or policy, like a man walking in the
dark? No, not in the dark; all was too bright. He could see but too
plainly--her!--felt impelled to draw nearer--</p>

<p>But at that instant, she stepped quickly from the byway into the main
road. "There it is," she said, pointing with a small white finger.</p>

<p>He held himself abruptly back. "What?" fell from his lips.</p>

<p>"The way in, of course," said the girl.</p>

<p>He moved now at her side; at the entrance, broad, imposing, she paused;
a thousand perfumes seemed wafted from the garden; the rustling of myriad
wings fell on the senses, like <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"
id="Page_176"></a>[pg 176]</span>faint cadences of music. The girl made a
courtesy; her red lips curved. "Welcome to Strathorn House, Mr. John
Steele!" she said gaily.</p>

<p>Within the stately house, near a recessed window at the front, a man
stood at that moment, reading a letter handed to him but a short time
before. This document, though brief, was absorbing:</p>

<p>"Shall be down to see you soon. Am sending this by private messenger who
may be trusted. Case coming on; links nearly all complete. Involve a new
and bewildering possibility that I must impart to you personally. Have
discovered the purpose of S.'s visit to the continent. It was--"</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale perused the words more rapidly; paused, on his face an
expression of eagerness, expectancy.</p>

<p>"So that was it," he said to himself slowly. "I might have known--"</p>

<p>Voices without caught his attention; he <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[pg 177]</span>glanced quickly through
the window. Jocelyn Wray and some one else had drawn near, were walking up
the marble steps.</p>

<p>"John Steele!" He, Lord Ronsdale, crumpled the paper in his hand.
"Here!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[pg

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2X'></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><a name='A_CONTEST'></a>A CONTEST</h3>


<p>A few days passed; the usual round of pastimes inseparable from house
parties served to while away the hours; other guests arrived, one or two
went. Lord Ronsdale had greeted John Steele perfunctorily; the other's
manner was likewise mechanically courteous. It could not very well have
been otherwise; a number of people were near.</p>

<p>"Come down for a little sport?" the nobleman, his hands carelessly
thrust into the pockets of his shooting trousers, had asked with a frosty
smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps--if there is any!" Steele allowed his glance for the fraction
of a moment to linger on Lord Ronsdale's face.</p>

<p>"I'll answer for that." A slight pause ensued. "Decided rather suddenly
to run down, didn't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[pg
179]</span>"Rather."</p>

<p>"Heard you were on the continent. From Sir Charles, don't you know.
Pleasant time, I trust?" he drawled.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" John Steele did not answer directly. "Your solicitude," he
laughed, "honors me--my Lord!"</p>

<p>And that had been all, all the words spoken, at least. To the others
there had been nothing beneath the surface between them; for the time the
two men constituted but two figures in a social gathering.</p>

<p>A rainy spell put a stop to outdoor diversions; for twenty-four hours
now the party had been thrown upon their own resources, to devise such
indoor amusement as occurred to them. Strathorn House, however, was large;
it had its concert stage, a modern innovation; its armory hall and its
ball-room. Pleasure seekers could and did find here ample facilities for
entertaining themselves.</p>

<p>The second morning of the dark weather discovered two of the guests in
the oak-paneled smoking-room of Strathorn House. One of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[pg 180]</span>them
brushed the ash from his cigar meditatively and then stretched himself more
comfortably in the great leather chair.</p>

<p>"No fox-hunt or fishing for any of us to-day," he remarked with a
yawn.</p>

<p>The other, who had been gazing through a window at a prospect of
dripping leaves and leaden sky, answered absently; then his attention
centered itself on the small figure of a boy coming up through the avenue
of trees toward a side entrance.</p>

<p>"Believe I shall run over to Germany very soon, Steele," went on the
first speaker.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" John Steele's brows drew together; the appearance of the lad
was vaguely familiar. He remembered him now, the hostler boy at the Golden
Lion.</p>

<p>"Yes; capital case coming on in the criminal courts there."</p>

<p>"And you don't want to miss it, Forsythe?"</p>

<p>"Not I! Weakness of mine, as you know. Most people look to novels or
plays for entertainment; I find mine in the real drama, unfolded every day
in the courts of justice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[pg
181]</span>Forsythe paused as if waiting for some comment from his
companion, but none came. John Steele watched the boy; he waved a paper in
his hand and called with easy familiarity to a housemaid in an open window
above:</p>

<p>"Telegram from London, Miss. My master at the Golden Lion said there'd
be a sixpence here for delivering it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be down in a moment, Impudence."</p>

<p>The silence that followed was again broken by Captain Forsythe's voice:
"There are one or two features in this German affair that remind me of
another case, some years back--one of our own--that interested me."</p>

<p>"Ah?" The listener's tone was only politely interrogatory.</p>

<p>"A case here in London--perhaps you have heard of it? The murder of a
woman, once well-known before the footlights, by a one-time champion of the
ring--the 'Frisco Pet, I think he was called."</p>

<p>The other moved slightly; his back had been toward Forsythe; he now
half-turned. "Yea, I have heard of it," he said slowly, after a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[pg 182]</span>pause.
"But why should this case across the water interest you; because it is
like--this other one you mention?"</p>

<p>"Because I once puzzled a bit over that one; investigated it somewhat on
my own account, don't you know."</p>

<p>"In what way?" Steele's manner was no longer indifferent. "I'm rather
familiar with some of the details myself," he added.</p>

<p>"Then it attracted you, too, as an investigator?" murmured the captain
in a gratified tone. "For your book, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But you haven't yet told me," in a keen, alert tone, "why
you looked into it, 'on your own account.' It seems simple, obvious. Not of
the kind that would attract one fond of nice criminal problems."</p>

<p>"That is just it," said Captain Forsythe, rising. "It was, perhaps, a
little too simple! too obvious."</p>

<p>"How," demanded John Steele, "can a matter of this sort be too obvious?
But," bending his eyes on the other, "you attended the trial of this
fellow?" His tone vibrated a little oddly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[pg
183]</span>"The last part of it; wasn't in England when it first came on;
and what I heard of it raised some questions and doubts in my mind. Not
that I haven't the greatest respect for English justice! However, I didn't
think much more about the case until a good many months later, when chance
alone drew my attention more closely to it."</p>

<p>"Chance?"</p>

<p>"Was down in the country--jolly good trout district--when one night,
while riding my favorite hobby, I happened to get on this almost-forgotten
case of the 'Frisco Pet. Whereupon the landlord of the inn where I put up,
informed me that one of the villagers in this identical little town had
been landlady at the place where the affair occurred."</p>

<p>"The woman who testified no one had been to her place that night
except--" John Steele spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"This fellow? Quite so." Captain Forsythe walked up and down. "Now, I'd
always had a little theory. Could never get out of my mind one sentence
this poor, ignorant fellow <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184"></a>[pg 184]</span>uttered at the trial. 'Seems as if I could
remember a man's face, a stranger's, that looked into mine that night, your
Lordship, but I ain't exactly cock-sure!' 'Ain't exactly cock-sure,'"
repeated Captain Forsythe. "That's what caught me. Would a man, not telling
the truth, be not quite 'cock-sure'; or would he testify to the face as a
fact?" The other did not answer. "So the impression grew on me. Can you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Hum! Very interesting, Forsythe; very ingenious; quite plausible!"</p>

<p>"Now you're laughing at me, Steele?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, my dear fellow, go on."</p>

<p>"The landlady's testimony excluded the face, made it a figment of an
imagination, disordered by drink!" Captain Forsythe waved his hand airily
as he stepped back and forth.</p>

<p>"You went to see this woman?"</p>

<p>"Out of curiosity, and found she was, indeed, the same person. She
seemed quite ill and feeble; I talked with her about an hour that day.
Tried in every way to get her to remember she <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[pg 185]</span>had possibly let in some
other person that night, but--"</p>

<p>"But?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, she stuck to her story," laughed Captain Forsythe. "Couldn't
move her an iota." One of the listener's arms fell to his side; his hand
closed hard. "Quite bowled over my little theory, don't you know! Of course
I told myself it didn't matter; the man convicted was gone, drowned.
However,--" he broke off. A swish of silk was heard in the hallway;
Forsythe stopped before the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Jocelyn! Haven't you a word in passing?"</p>

<p>She paused, looked in. Amid neutral shades the girl's slender figure
shone most insistent; her gown, of a color between rose and pink, was
warm-hued rather than bright, like the tints in an ancient embroidery.
Around her neck gleamed a band of old cloth of silver but the warmth of
tone did not cease at the argent edge, but leaped over to kiss the fair
cheeks and soft, smiling lips. "Is this the way you men amuse <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[pg
186]</span>yourselves?" she asked with a laugh. "Talking shop, no
doubt?"</p>

<p>"Afraid we must plead guilty," said Captain Forsythe.</p>

<p>"And that is why," with a quick sidelong glance, drawing her skirts
around her as she stood gracefully poised, "Mr. Steele appears so
interested?"</p>

<p>"Interested?" The subject of her comment seemed to pull himself together
with a start, regarded her. Was he, in the surprise of the moment, just in
the least disconcerted by that bright presence, the beautiful clear eyes,
straight, direct, though laughing? "Perhaps appearances are--" he found
himself saying.</p>

<p>"Deceptive!" she completed lightly. "Well, if you weren't interested,
Captain Forsythe was. He, I know, is quite incorrigible when you get him on
his hobby."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Miss Jocelyn!"</p>

<p>She came forward; light and brightness entered the room with her.
"Quite!" The slender figure stood between the two men. "We <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[pg 187]</span>expect
any time he'll be looking around here next, to find something to
investigate!"</p>

<p>"Here?" John Steele smiled. "What should he find here?"</p>

<p>"In sleepy Strathorn? True!"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle smote the air; Steele's glance turned to the window.
The boy, having delivered his message, had left the door; with lips
puckered to the loud and imperfect rendition of a popular street melody, he
was making his way through the grounds. Involuntarily the man's look
lingered on him. "A telegram from London? For whom?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's hopeless, Captain Forsythe. Nothing ever happens at
Strathorn." At the instant the girl's laughing voice seemed a little
farther off. "If something only would--to help pass the time. Don't you
agree with me, Mr. Steele?"</p>

<p>"I--" his glance returned to her quickly, "by all means!"</p>

<p>She looked at him; had she detected that momentary swerving from the
serious consideration <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188"></a>[pg 188]</span>of her light words? Her own eyes turned to
the window where they saw nothing but rain. She smiled vaguely, stood with
her hands behind her; it was he now who regarded her, straight, slender,
lithe. There was also something inflexible appearing in that young form,
though so replete with grace and charm.</p>

<p>"To help pass the time!" John Steele laughed. "I--let us hope so."</p>

<p>There had been moments in the past when she had felt she could not quite
understand him; they were moments like these when she seemed to become
aware of something obscuring, falling before her--between them--that seemed
to hold him aloof from her, from the others, to invest him almost with
mystery. Mystery,--romantic idea! A slight laugh welled from the white
throat. In these prosaic days!</p>

<p>"By the way, what particular case were you discussing when I happened
by?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very new," answered the military man, "an old crime perpetrated
by a fellow called the--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[pg
189]</span>"Beg pardon!" A footman stood in the doorway. "Sir Charles'
compliments to the gentlemen, and will they be good enough to join him in
armory hall?"</p>

<p>John Steele turned quickly to the servant, so quickly a close observer
might have fancied he welcomed the interruption. "Captain Forsythe's and
Mr. Steele's compliments to Sir Charles," he said at once, "and say it will
give them pleasure to comply. That is," he added, bowing, "with your
permission, Miss Wray."</p>

<p>She assented lightly; preceded by the girl, the two men left the room
and mounted the broad stairway leading to the second story.</p>

<p>Armory hall was a large and lofty chamber with vaulted ceiling, that
dated back almost to the early Norman period; its walls, decorated in
geometrical designs, were covered with many varieties of antique weapons of
warfare; halberd and mace gleamed and mingled with harquebus, poleax or
lance. At one end of the hall were ranged in a row suits of armor which at
first glance looked like real knights, drawn up in <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[pg 190]</span>company front; then the
empty helmets dawned on the beholder, transforming them into mere vacuous
relics.</p>

<p>As Steele and his companion together with Jocelyn Wray entered, sounds
of merriment and applause greeted the ear; two men in fencing array who had
apparently just ended a match were the center of an animated company.</p>

<p>"A little contest with the foils! A fencing bout! Good!" exclaimed
Forsythe.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Wray walked over to the group and Forsythe followed.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Ronsdale!" A number of people applauded.</p>

<p>"He has won. Now the reward! What is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Not so fast! Here are others."</p>

<p>"True!" Ronsdale looked around with his cold smile; his glance vaguely
included John Steele and Captain Forsythe.</p>

<p>"Count me out!" laughed the latter. "Not in my line, don't you know,
since I joined the retired list!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[pg
191]</span>"However, there's Steele," Sir Charles, pipe in hand,
remarked.</p>

<p>Ronsdale had stepped to the girl's side; his eyes, regarding her in the
least degree too steadily, shone with a warmer gleam. She appeared either
not to notice, or to mind; with look unreservedly bright, she smiled back
at him; then her gaze met John Steele's.</p>

<p>"Do you use the foils, Mr. Steele?"</p>

<p>He moved forward; Lord Ronsdale stood near her, bending over with a
slightly proprietary air.</p>

<p>"I--" Steele looked at them, at the girl's questioning eyes. "Only a
little!"</p>

<p>"Then you must try conclusions with Lord Ronsdale!" called out Sir
Charles. "As victor over the rest he must meet all comers."</p>

<p>A light swept John Steele's face; perhaps the situation appealed to a
certain sense of humor; he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be put out by, being beaten by Ronsdale," interposed an
observer. "Had the reputation of being one of the best swordsmen <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[pg 192]</span>on the
continent; has even had, I believe," with a laugh, "one or two little
affairs of honor."</p>

<p>"Honor!" Steele's glance swung around, played brightly on the
nobleman.</p>

<p>The latter's face remained impassive; he lifted his foil carelessly and
swung it; the hiss that followed might have been construed as a challenge.
John Steele tossed aside his coat.</p>

<p>"Can't promise this contest will be as interesting as the other little
affairs you speak of!" he laughed. Through the fine, white linen of his
shirt could be discerned the superb swell and molding of the muscles, as he
now, with the gleaming toy in hand, stood before Ronsdale.</p>

<p>The latter's eyes suddenly narrowed; a covert expectancy made itself
felt in his manner. "Aren't you going to roll up your sleeve?" he asked
softly. "Usually find it gives greater freedom of movement, myself."</p>

<p>Steele did not at once reply; in his eyes bent on Ronsdale a question
seemed to flash; then a bolder, more daring light replaced it. "Perhaps you
are right!" he said coolly, and following the nobleman's example he pushed
back <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[pg
193]</span>his sleeve. The action revealed the splendid arm of the
perfectly-trained athlete marked, however, by a great scar extending from
just above the wrist to the elbow. Lord Ronsdale's eyes fastened on it; his
lips moved slightly but if any sound fell from them, it was rendered
inaudible by Sir Charles' exclamation:</p>

<p>"Bad jab, that, Steele! Looks as if it might have been made by an
African spear!"</p>

<p>"No." John Steele smiled, encountering other glances, curious,
questioning. "Can't include the land of ivory among the countries I've been
in," he added easily.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale breathed quickly. "Recent wound, I should say."</p>

<p>"Not very old," said John Steele.</p>

<p>"If there's a good story back of it, we'll have it later," Captain
Forsythe remarked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Steele is too modest to tell it," Ronsdale again
interposed.</p>

<p>"Your good opinion flatters me." Steele's eyes met the other's squarely;
then he made a brusk movement. "But if you are ready?"</p>

<p>Their blades crossed. Ronsdale's suppleness <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[pg 194]</span>of wrist and arm, his cold
steadiness, combined with a knowledge of many fine artifices, had already
made him a favorite with those of the men who cared to back their opinions
with odd pounds. As he pressed his advantage, the girl's eyes turned to
John Steele; her look seemed to express just a shade of disappointment. His
manner, or method, appeared perfunctory, too perfunctory! Why did he not
enter into the contest with more abandon? Between flashes of steel she
again saw the scar on his arm; it seemed to exercise a sort of fascination
over her.</p>

<p>What had caused it, this jagged, irregular mark? He had not said. Lord
Ronsdale's words, "A recent wound--perhaps Mr. Steele is too modest--"
returned to her. It was not so much the words as the tone, an inflection
almost too fine to notice, a covert sneer. Or, was it that? Her brows drew
together slightly. Of course not. And yet she felt vaguely puzzled, as if
some fine instinct in her divined something, she knew not what, beneath the
surface. Absurd! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195"
id="Page_195"></a>[pg 195]</span>Her eyes at that moment met John Steele's.
Did he read, guess what was passing through her brain? An instant's
carelessness nearly cost him the match.</p>

<p>"Ten to five!" one of the men near her called out jovially. "Odds on
Ronsdale! Any takers?"</p>

<p>"Done!"</p>

<p>She saw John Steele draw himself back sharply just in time; she also
fancied a new, ominous gleam in his eyes. His demeanor underwent an abrupt
change. If Ronsdale's quickness was cat-like, the other's movements had now
all the swiftness and grace of a panther. The girl's eyes widened; all
vague questioning vanished straightway from her mind; it was certainly very
beautiful, that agility, that deft, incessant wrist play.</p>

<p>"Hello!" Through the swishing of steel she heard again the man at her
side exclaim, make some laughing remark: "Perhaps I'd better hedge--"</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, with a fiercer thrusting <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[pg 196]</span>and parrying of blades the
end came; a sudden irresistible movement of John Steele's arm, and the
nobleman's blade clattered to the floor.</p>

<p>"Egad! I never saw anything prettier!" Sir Charles came forward quickly.
"Met your match that time, Ronsdale," in a tone the least bantering.</p>

<p>The nobleman stooped for his foil. "That time, yes!" he drawled. If he
felt chagrin, or annoyance, he concealed it.</p>

<p>"Lucky it wasn't one of those real affairs of honor, eh?" some one whom
Ronsdale had defeated laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Again he replied. Steele found himself walking with Jocelyn Wray toward
the window. Across the room a footman who had been waiting for the
conclusion of the contest, and an opportune moment, now approached Lord
Ronsdale and extended a salver.</p>

<p>"It came a short time ago, my Lord!"</p>

<p>John Steele heard; his glance flashed toward Ronsdale. The telegram,
then, had been for--? He saw an inscrutable smile cross the nobleman's
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[pg
197]</span>"Any more aspirants?" the military man called out.</p>

<p>"Only myself left," observed Sir Charles. "And I resign the
privilege!"</p>

<p>"Then," said the girl, standing somewhat apart with John Steele, near
one of the great open windows, "must you, Mr. Steele, be proclaimed
victor?"</p>

<p>"Victor!" He looked down. Between them bright colors danced, reflections
of hues from the old stained glass above; they shone like red roses fallen
from her lap at his feet. For a moment he continued to regard them; then
slowly gazed up to the soft colored gown, to the beautiful young face, the
hair that shone brightly against the background of branches and twigs,
gleaming with watery drops like thousands of gems. "Victor!" He--</p>

<p>A door closed quietly as Lord Ronsdale went out.</p>

<h3><a name='WAYS_AND_MEANS'></a>WAYS AND MEANS</h3>


<p>The afternoon of that same day there arrived at the village of Strathorn
from London a discreet-looking little man who, descending at the Golden
Lion, was shown to a private sitting-room on the second story. Calling for
a half-pint from the best tap and casually surveying the room, he settled
himself in a chair with an air of nonchalance, which a certain eagerness in
his eyes seemed to belie.</p>

<p>"Any mail or message for me, landlord?" he inquired, giving his name,
when that worthy reappeared with the tankard.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Nor any callers?"</p>

<p>"None that I've heard of--" A sound of wheels at that moment
interrupted; the landlord went to the window. "Why, it's his lordship," he
remarked. "And such weather to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199"></a>[pg 199]</span>out in!" as a sudden gust of rain beat
against the pane. "Lord Ronsdale who is staying at Strathorn House," he
explained for the stranger's benefit. "And he's coming in!"</p>

<p>The host hurried to the door but already a footstep was heard on the
stairway and the voice of the nobleman inquiring for the new-comer's
room.</p>

<p>"Right up this way! The gentleman is in here, your Lordship," called
down the landlord. Lord Ronsdale mounted leisurely and entered the
room.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to have the honor of a call from your lordship," said
the guest of the Golden Lion, bowing low. "If your lordship had indicated
to me his pleasure--"</p>

<p>The nobleman whipped a greatcoat from his shoulders and tossed it to the
landlord. "Was coming to the village on another little matter, and thought
I might as well drop in and see you," he observed to the guest, "instead of
waiting for you to come to Strathorn House. You have the stock-lists and
market prices with you?" he queried meaningly. The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[pg 200]</span>other answered in the
affirmative. "Very good, we will consider the matter, and--you may go,
landlord."</p>

<p>But when the innkeeper had taken his departure no further word was said
by the nobleman of securities or values; Lord Ronsdale gazed keenly at his
companion. Without, the wind swept drearily down the little winding street,
and sighed about the broad overhanging eaves.</p>

<p>"Well," he spoke quickly, "I fancy you have a little something to tell
me, Mr. Gillett?"</p>

<p>"'A little something?'" The latter rubbed his hands. "More than a
little! Your lordship little dreamed, when--"</p>

<p>"Spare me your observations," broke in the nobleman. "Come at once to
the business on hand." His voice, though low, had a strident pitch; behind
it might be fancied strained nerves.</p>

<p>"As your lordship knows, good fortune or chance favored me at the start;
that is, along one line, the line of general investigation. The special
inquiry which your lordship mentioned, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[pg 201]</span>just as he was leaving my
office, proved for a time most illusive."</p>

<p>"You mean the object of John Steele's visit to the continent?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And the object of that visit solved, I have now a matter of
greatest importance to communicate, so important it could only be imparted
by word of mouth!" The police agent spoke hastily and moved nearer.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Lord Ronsdale's thin, cold lips raised slightly, but not to
suggest a smile; his eyes met the police agent's. "You have reached a
conclusion? One that you sought to reject, perhaps, but that wouldn't be
discarded?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett looked at him earnestly. "You don't mean--it isn't possible
that you knew all the while--?"</p>

<p>The white, aristocratic hand of Lord Ronsdale waved. "Let us start at
the beginning."</p>

<p>"True, your Lordship," Mr. Gillett swallowed. "As your lordship is
aware, we were fortunate enough in the beginning to find out <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[pg 202]</span>through
our agent in Tasmania that John Steele came to that place in a little
trading schooner, the <i>Laura Deane</i>, of Portsmouth; that he had been
rescued from a tiny uncharted reef, or isle, on December twenty-first, some
three years before. The spot, by longitude and latitude, marks, through an
odd coincidence, the place where the <i>Lord Nelson</i> met her fate."</p>

<p>"A coincidence truly," murmured the nobleman. "But at this stage in your
reasoning you recalled that all on board were embarked in the ships' boats
and reached civilization, except possibly--"</p>

<p>"A few of my charges between decks? True; I remembered that. A bad lot
of ugly brutes!" Mr. Gillett paused; Lord Ronsdale raised his head. "The
story of John Steele's rescue," went on Mr. Gillett, "as told by himself,"
significantly, "was well known in Tasmania and not hard to learn. A man of
splendid intellect, a lawyer by profession, he had been passenger on a
merchant vessel, the <i>Mary Vernon</i>, of Baltimore, United States. This
vessel, like the <i>Lord Nelson</i>, had come to grief; after being <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[pg 203]</span>tossed
about, a helpless, water-logged wreck, it had finally been abandoned. All
of those in John Steele's boat had perished except him; some had gone mad
through thirst and suffering; others had killed their fellows in a frenzy.
Being of superb physique, having been through much physical training--" the
listener stirred in his chair--"he managed to survive, to reach the little
isle, where, according to his story, he remained almost a year."</p>

<p>"A year? Then he set foot in Tasmania about four years after the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> went down," observed the nobleman, a curious glitter in his
eyes. "Four years after," he repeated, accenting the last word.</p>

<p>"Such were the details gathered in Tasmania," answered the police
agent.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Lord Ronsdale. "You subsequently learned with more
definiteness the actual circumstances of his rescue?"</p>

<p>"From the mate of the <i>Laura Deane</i>, the schooner that rescued him
from the isle, and one of her crew whom I managed to locate at Plymouth, as
I have informed your lordship by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204"></a>[pg 204]</span>letter," answered Mr. Gillett. "These men
now furnish lodgings to seamen, and incidentally shanghai a few of them for
dubious craft! Both of them, the mate and the sailor, recalled the man of
fine bearing and education whom they found on the little isle, a sort of
Greek statue, half-clothed in rags, so to speak, who made his personality
felt at once on these simple, ignorant fellows!" Mr. Gillett paused to look
at Lord Ronsdale, seemed waiting for the latter to say something, but the
nobleman only leaned forward and pushed at the coals with a poker.</p>

<p>"Which brings to my mind the one point," with emphasis, "that I haven't
been able so far to reconcile or to explain. Your lordship, who seems to
have divined a great deal, can, perhaps. A man of fine education and
bearing, as I said, yet the other had been--"</p>

<p>"It is your business, not mine, to explain," interrupted the listener.
"Tell all you know."</p>

<p>"At the spring on the little island the seamen filled their water-butts;
this kept them several days, mixing labor with skylarking, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[pg 205]</span>during
which time one of them picked up something, a pouch marked with a
name."</p>

<p>"Which was--?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett leaned forward, spoke softly; Lord Ronsdale stared straight
ahead. "Of course," he said, "of course!"</p>

<p>"This, I will confess, startled, puzzled me," continued the police agent
after a pause. "What did it mean? I tried to explain it in a dozen
different ways but none of them seemed exactly to fit. Then it was that the
line of special investigation helped. John Steele's outing to which you
directed my attention was passed on the continent. What did he do there;
was it business; was it pleasure took him there? After a good deal of
pains, we discovered that he visited a certain large building, centrally
located. This proved a starting-point; why did he go there? At the top was
a studio; from the concierge we learned that he had asked for the artist.
From the artist we ascertained that John Steele had bought a picture; that
he had called several times to watch the painter at his work. So far, so
good, or bad! For was it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206"></a>[pg 206]</span>likely John Steele had come to Paris to
buy a bit of canvas, or was his interest in art assumed to cover his real
purpose? When he left the studio, did he, without the knowledge of the
concierge, call on some one else in the building?</p>

<p>"This thought led to an inspection of the tenants. They proved of all
sorts and kinds; the place was a beehive; hundreds of people entered and
left every day. At this time I happened on an item in a periodical about
some remarkable work in a certain line by a high-class medical specialist.
Here is the paragraph."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale took the slip of paper the other handed him and briefly
looked at it. "You visited this person?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as his office address was mentioned as being in the large building
we were interested in. But at the moment I had no suspicion that John
Steele's pilgrimage to Paris could have been for the purpose of
consulting,--"</p>

<p>"An eminent specialist in the line of removing birth-marks," glancing at
the slip of paper, "or other disfigurements--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[pg
207]</span>"Such as I described to your lordship from the book that day in
the office," murmured the police agent.</p>

<p>For some moments both were again silent; only the sounds of the wind and
the rain, mingled with monotonous creakings, broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"You say this shipwrecked man was like a Greek statue, half clothed in
rags. Perhaps then," slowly, "since he was only half-clothed the rescuers
might have noticed--"</p>

<p>"I sought them at once," with sudden eagerness, "to verify what your
lordship suggests, and I have their full corroboration; what the evidence
of their eyes told them, that the rescued man bore on his arm the exact
markings described in my book."</p>

<p>"A coincidence not easily accounted for." The speaker's tones had a
rasping sound. "And now--"</p>

<p>"One question, my Lord. He is discerning--knows that you--"</p>

<p>"Knows? Yes; he found that out one day <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[pg 208]</span>in Hyde Park, never mind
how; about the same time I, too, learned something."</p>

<p>"And yet he deliberately comes down here, dares to leave London where at
least his chances are better for--but why? It is unreasonable; I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"Why?" Lord Ronsdale's smile was not agreeable. "When does a man become
illogical, stray from the path good reasoning should keep him in? When does
he accept chances, however desperate?"</p>

<p>"When?" The police agent's tones expressed vague wonder. "Why,
when--there is a woman in the case!" suddenly.</p>

<p>"A woman, or a girl."</p>

<p>"Your lordship means--"</p>

<p>"One who is beautiful enough to enmesh any man's fancy," he spoke as to
himself, "whose golden hair is a web to draw lovers like the fleece of old;
whose eyes like the sunny heavens tempt them to bask in their light."</p>

<p>The words were mocking yet seemed to force themselves from his lips.
"When you add that she has high position; is as opulent in the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[pg 209]</span>world's
goods as she is rich in personal--" abruptly he paused. "But this is
irrelevant," he added almost angrily. "Is there anything else you have to
tell me?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing, and it may have no bearing on the case; some one who
has not been seen in these parts in years, the red-headed son of the
landlady where the Gerard murder occurred has been back in London,
and--Steele's been looking for him. For what purpose, I don't know." The
nobleman moved quickly. "But he hasn't found him--yet; apparently the
fellow took alarm, knowing the police agent might want him, and vanished
again."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale moistened his lips; then got up, walked back and forth. A
brisker gust, without, and the tin symbol of the Golden Lion over the
entrance to the inn swung with a harsh rattle almost around the bar that
held it. The nobleman stopped short; from the dim corner where he stood his
eyes gleamed with animal brightness.</p>

<p>"And now?" suggested Mr. Gillett. "Your lordship of course knows what
this means, if <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210"
id="Page_210"></a>[pg 210]</span>your lordship uses the weapons you have in
your hands? The penalty for one transported returning to England is--"</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted the other. "He has, however, dared to come back,
to incur that risk. Any plea he could hope to make," Lord Ronsdale spoke
with studied deliberation, "to justify the act, he could
not--substantiate." The speaker lingered on the word then went on more
crisply. "He stands in the position of a person who has broken one of the
most exacting laws of the realm and one which has on all occasions been
rigorously enforced. He has presumed to trespass in the highest circles, to
mingle with people of rank, our gentry, our ladies--"</p>

<p>"Then your lordship will--"</p>

<p>"I have made my plans. And--I intend to act."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"But would it not be better to wait until he returns to London, my
Lord?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[pg
211]</span>"And give him more time to--" he broke off. "We act here, at
once!"</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale again seated himself; his face had regained its hard mask;
he motioned the other man to draw his chair closer. "I'll tell you how to
proceed."</p>

<h3><a name='FESTIVITIES'></a>FESTIVITIES</h3>


<p>The windows in Strathorn House shone bright; from within came the sound
of music; in the billiard room, adjoining the spacious hall, a number of
persons were smoking, playing, or watching the dancers. At one of the
tables two men had about finished a game; by the skilful stroke of him who
showed the better score, the balls clicked briskly, separated, and came
together once more.</p>

<p>"Enough to go out with!" The player, Captain Forsythe, counted his
score. "Shall we say another, Steele?"</p>

<p>"Not for me!" John Steele placed his cue in the rack. "I'm out for a
breath of air." And he stepped through an open French window, leading upon
a balcony that almost spanned the rear of the house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Steele seems to be rather out of form <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[pg 213]</span>to-night." A plump, short
woman with doll-like eyes, who had been watching the game from a seat
near-by, now spoke, with subtle meaning in her accents.</p>

<p>"Quite so. Can't really understand it. Steele can put up a deuced strong
game, don't you know, but to-night--Did you notice how he failed at one of
the easiest shots?"</p>

<p>"That was when Jocelyn Wray looked in," murmured the other.</p>

<p>"Miss Wray!" Captain Forsythe set the balls for a practice shot. "Well,
Steele's a splendid chap," he said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"You have known him for some time?"</p>

<p>"Not a great while; he's rather a new man, don't you know. But Sir
Charles is quite democratic; took him up, well, as one might in Australia,
without," good-naturedly, "inquiring into his family or his antecedents, or
all that sort of rubbish."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Her voice was non-committal. "But as for its being
rubbish--"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Mrs. Nallis!" The other's tone was expostulating. "Strong
man; splendid <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214"
id="Page_214"></a>[pg 214]</span>sort of chap, Steele! A jolly good
athlete, too! Witness our little fencing contest of this morning!"</p>

<p>"True! You are an evident admirer of Mr. Steele, Captain Forsythe. And
if I am not mistaken," she laughed, "others share your opinion. Sir
Charles, for example, and Jocelyn Wray. She didn't look displeased this
morning, did she? When the contest was over, I mean. Not that I would
imply--of course, her position and his--so far apart from a social
standpoint." A retort of some kind seemed about to spring from the
listener's lips but she did not give him the opportunity to speak; went on:
"Besides, when I came here, I understood a marriage had been, or was about
to be arranged between Sir Charles' niece and--"</p>

<p>"Not interrupting a bit of gossip, I trust?" a cynical voice inquired;
at the same time a third person, who had quietly approached, paused to
regard them.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lord Ronsdale!" Just for an instant the lady was disconcerted.
"Gossip?" She <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215"></a>[pg 215]</span>repeated in a tone that meant: "How can
you?"</p>

<p>He waved his hand; leaned against the table. "Beg your pardon! Very
wrong of me, no doubt; only the truth is--" his lashes drooped slightly to
veil his eyes, "I like a bit of gossip myself occasionally!"</p>

<p>"We were talking about your friendly set-to with John Steele," said
Captain Forsythe bluntly.</p>

<p>The nobleman's long fingers lifted, pulled at his mustache; in the
bright glare, his nails, perfectly kept, looked sharp and pointed. "Ah,
indeed!" he remarked. "Steele is handy with the foils; an all-round
sportsman, I fancy; or once was!" softly.</p>

<p>"Never heard of him, though, in the amateur sporting world!" observed
the lady. "Never saw his name mentioned in any gentlemen's events--tennis
or golf tournaments, track athletics, rowing, and all that."</p>

<p>"No?" Lord Ronsdale gazed down; half-sitting on the corner of the table,
he swung one glossy shoe to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[pg
216]</span>"Perhaps he's hiding his light under a bushel?" said the
lady.</p>

<p>The nobleman made a sound. "Perhaps!"</p>

<p>"I was asking Captain Forsythe about his antecedents. No one here seems
to know. Possibly you can enlighten us."</p>

<p>"I?" Lord Ronsdale's tone was purring. "Why should I be able to? But I
see Miss Wray," rising and walking toward the door. "My dance, don't you
know."</p>

<p>She gazed after him. "I wonder why Lord Ronsdale does not approve of, or
shall we say, dislikes Mr. John Steele?"</p>

<p>"Eh?--what?--I never noticed."</p>

<p>"A man notice?" She laughed. "But your game of billiards? You are
looking for some one. If I will do--?"</p>

<p>"Delighted!" he Said with an accent of reserve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the principal subject of this conversation had been walking
slowly on the broad stone balcony toward the ball-room; there he had
stopped; then stepping to the balustrade, he stood looking off. The night
was warm; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[pg
217]</span>in the sky, stars seemed trying to maintain their places between
dark, floating clouds. Near at hand the foliage shimmered with pale flashes
of light; the perfumes of dew-laden flowers were like those of an oriental
bower. Faint rustlings, soft undertones broke upon the ear from dark
places; mists seemed drawn like phantom ribbons, now here, now there. He
looked at the stars; watched one of them, very small, drop into the maw of
a black-looking monster of vapor. As it vanished the sound of music was
wafted from within; John Steele listened; they were beginning once more to
dance.</p>

<p>He glanced around; splashes of color met the eye; hues that shifted,
mingled; came swiftly and went. In the great hall, staring Lelys and
Knellers looked down from their high, gilded frames; the glaring lights of
a great crystal chandelier threw a flood of rays over the scene at once
brilliant and dazzling. Steele stepped toward the window, paused; his eyes
seemed searching the throng. They found what they sought, a slender, erect
form, the gown soft, white, like foam; a face, animated, joyous. For <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[pg 218]</span>an
instant only, however, he saw the beautiful features; then as Jocelyn
turned in the dance, around her waist glimpsed a black band, tipped by
slender masculine fingers; above, a cynical countenance. Or was it all
cynical now? A brief glance showed more than the habitual expression, a
sedulousness--some passionate feeling? Lord Ronsdale's look seemed once
more to say he held and claimed her; that she was his, or soon would
be.</p>

<p>A fleeting picture; she was gone and other figures intervened. John
Steele stood with hands tightly clasped. Then his gaze gradually lowered;
he moved restlessly back and forth; but the music sounded louder and he
walked away from it, to the end of the balcony and again looked off--into
darkness.</p>

<p>The moments passed; a distant buzz replaced melody; the human murmur,
the scraping of strings. From the forest came a far-away cry, the
melancholy sound of some wood-creature. He continued motionless, suddenly
wheeled swiftly.</p>

<p>"That is you, Mr. Steele?" A voice, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[pg 219]</span>young, gay, sounded near;
Jocelyn Wray came toward him; from her shoulders floated a white scarf.
"You have come out for the freshness of the garden? Although," she added,
"you shouldn't altogether seclude yourself from the madding crowd."</p>

<p>"No?" In the eyes that met hers flashed a question, the question that he
had ever been asking himself since coming to Strathorn House, that had
driven him there.</p>

<p>Did she note the strangeness of the look she seemed to have surprised on
his face? Her own glance grew on the instant slightly puzzled, showed a
passing constraint; then her manner became light again. "No. Especially
as--You are leaving to-morrow, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He tried to speak in conventional tones; but his gaze swerved
from the graceful figure with its dim, white lines that changed and
fluttered in the faint breath of air, stealing so gently by them and away.
"My time is almost up; the allotted period of my brief Elysium!" he
half-laughed.</p>

<p>"And yet it was rather hard to get you here, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[pg 220]</span>wasn't it? You remember
you quite scorned our first invitation," gaily.</p>

<p>"Scorned?" In the semi-darkness he could only divine her features. "That
is hardly the word."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? Well, then, you had business more important," she
laughed.</p>

<p>"Not more important,--imperative." Was his voice, beneath an assumption
of carelessness, just a shade uncertain? again it became conventional.
"I--have enjoyed myself immensely."</p>

<p>"Have you?" She glanced at him; a flicker of light touched the strong
face. "So good of you to say so! I believe that answer is the proper
formula. Invented by our ancestors," lightly, "and handed down!"</p>

<p>He did not at once reply; again she caught a suggestion of that
searching look she had noted before, and after a moment the girl turned;
walking to a rose-bush that partly screened one end of the balcony, she
bent over the flowers. "Of course I might use my influence with my aunt to
have the time allotted you, as you put <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[pg 221]</span>it, extended. Especially
as you are so appreciative!" she laughed. "Until after the children's
f&ecirc;te, for example! What do you say? Shall I plead for you until then?
If you will promise to make yourself very useful!"</p>

<p>"I--you are very good--but--"</p>

<p>"Don't!" She spread out her hands. "Forgive me for presuming to think
that Strathorn House and its poor attractions could longer keep Mr. John
Steele from smoky London-town and the drone of its courts!"</p>

<p>"It is not that"--he began, stopped.</p>

<p>"Go; we abandon you to your fate." It may be that he had made her feel
she had been somewhat over gracious, as he had, once or twice before,--that
night at the opera, when they had first met; afterward on taking leave of
him on the return from Hyde Park. But she only laughed again, perhaps a
little constrainedly this time. "You will miss the revival of a few old
rural pastimes!" she went on. "That sounds quite trivial to you though,
does it not? Several of our present guests will stay, however; others are
coming; Lord Ronsdale," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222"
id="Page_222"></a>[pg 222]</span>lightly, "has even begged to remain; we
shall probably lead the old country-dance."</p>

<p>"Lord Ronsdale!--You!"--The flame again played in the dark eyes, more
strongly now, no longer to be suppressed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Steele!" Her brows arched in sudden surprise; she drew back a
little.</p>

<p>He seemed about to speak but with an effort checked himself and looked
down. "I beg your pardon." His face was half-turned; for a moment he did
not go on. "I beg your pardon." He again raised his head; his face was
steady, very steady now; his words too. "Your mentioning Lord Ronsdale
reminded me of a social obligation; which I have neglected, or forgotten;
the pleasure," with a slight laugh, "of congratulating you--is that the
word? Or Lord Ronsdale,--he, I believe, is the one to be
congratulated!"</p>

<p>"Congratulated?" Her face had changed, grown colder. His hand grasped
the stone balustrade, but he forced a smile to his lips. "I can not imagine
who has started--why you speak thus. Lord Ronsdale is an old friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[pg
223]</span>my uncle, and--mine, too. But that is all; I am not--have not
been. You are mistaken."</p>

<p>"Mistaken?" The word broke from him quickly; the strained expression of
his face gave way to another he could ill conceal. Before the light in his
gaze, the fire, the ardency, her own slowly fell; she turned slightly as if
to go. But he made no effort to stop her, spoke no word. She took a step,
hesitated; John Steele moved.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said slowly. "I am leaving rather early in the morning; I
shall not see you again."</p>

<p>"Good-by." She raised her head with outward assurance. "At least until
we meet in London," she ended lightly.</p>

<p>"That may not be--"</p>

<p>"Why, you are not thinking of leaving London?" with gaiety perhaps a
trifle forced, "of deserting your dingy metropolis?"</p>

<p>He did not answer; she looked at him quickly; something in his face held
her; a little of the lightness went from hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[pg
224]</span>"Once more, good-by, Miss--Jocelyn."</p>

<p>His look was now resolute; but his voice lingered on her name. He
extended his hand in the matter-of-fact manner of one who knew very well
what he had to do; the girl's eyes widened on him. Did she realize he was
saying "Good-by" to her for all time? She held her head higher, pressed her
lips slightly closer. Then she sought to withdraw her hand but he, as
hardly knowing what he did, or yielding to sudden, irresistible temptation,
clasped for an instant the slim fingers closer; they seemed to quiver in
his. The girl's figure moved somewhat from him; she stood almost amid the
roses, dark spots that nodded around her. The bush was a mass of bloom; did
she tremble ever so slightly? Or was it but the fine, sensitive petals
behind her that stirred when kissed by the sweet-scented breeze?</p>

<p>John Steele breathed deeply; he continued to regard her, so fair, so
beautiful! A leaf fell; she made a movement; it seemed to awaken him to
realization. He started and threw back his head; the dark, glowing eyes
became once more <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225"
id="Page_225"></a>[pg 225]</span>resolute. An instant, and he bent; a
breath, or his lips, swept the delicate, white fingers; then he dropped
them. Her hand swung back against the cold stone; on her breast, something
bright--an ornament--fluttered, became still. Behind, a bird chirped; her
glance turned toward the ball-room.</p>

<p>"I--"</p>

<p>Other voices, loud, merry, coming from one of the open French windows
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn!" They called to her; faces looked out. "Jocelyn!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" She was walking rapidly from him now, a laugh, a little forced,
on her lips.</p>

<p>On the balcony a number of persons appeared. "A cotillion! We're going
to have a cotillion; that is, if you--"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you wish." The gay group surrounded her; light, heedless
voices mingled; then she, all of them, vanished into the ball-room.</p>

<p>John Steele moved slowly down the stone steps leading to the garden
below. One thought vibrated in his mind. Sir Charles had <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[pg 226]</span>erred
when he told him that day in the park of his niece and Ronsdale. Perhaps
because the wish was father to the thought--But the girl's own assurance
dispelled all doubts and fears. He, John Steele, had been mistaken. Those
were her words, "Mistaken!"</p>

<p>He could go away now, gladly, gladly! No; not that, perhaps; but he
could go. If need be,--far from England; never to be seen, heard of, more
by her. He could go, and she would never know she had honored by her
friendship, had sheltered beneath her roof, one who--As he walked down the
dimly lighted path somebody--a man--standing under the trees, at one side,
at that moment touched his arm.</p>

<p>"I should like to speak with you, sir!" said a voice, and turning with a
quick jerk, Steele saw the familiar features of Gillett, the former police
agent; behind him, other men.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>The Scotland Yard man coughed significantly. "Out here is a nice, quiet
place for a word, or so," he said in his blandest manner. "And if you will
be so good--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[pg
227]</span>John Steele's reply was as emphatic as it was sudden; he had
been dreaming; the awakening had come. A glint like lightning flashed from
his eyes; well, here was something tangible to be grappled with! A laugh
burst from his throat; with the quickness of thought he launched himself
forward.</p>

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2XIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><a name='THE_PRINCESS_SUITE'></a>THE PRINCESS SUITE</h3>


<p>A House maid, some time later that night, moved noiselessly over the
heavy rugs in the boudoir of the princess suite, next to armory hall on the
second story of Strathorn House. Glancing nervously about her from time to
time, the woman trimmed a candle here and set another there; then lifted
with ponderous brass tongs a few coals and placed them on the smoldering
bed in the delicately tinted fireplace. After which she stood before it in
the attitude of one who is waiting though not with stolid and undisturbed
patience.</p>

<p>A clock ticked loudly on the mantel; she looked at it, around her at the
shadows of two beautiful marbles on pedestals of malachite. Moving into the
bedroom beyond, she took from a wardrobe of old French workmanship a rose
dressing-gown; this, and a pair of slippers <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[pg 229]</span>of like color she brought
out and placed near the fire. As she did so, she started, straightened
suddenly; then her expression changed; the voice of Lord Ronsdale without
was followed by that of Jocelyn Wray.</p>

<p>"Never fear! They'll get the fellow yet," my lord had said.</p>

<p>Jocelyn answered mechanically; the door opened; the maid caught a
glimpse of Ronsdale's face, of the cold eyes that looked the least bit
annoyed.</p>

<p>"Although it was most bungling on their part to have permitted him to
get away!" he went on. "I hope, however, this little unexpected episode
won't disturb your rest." An instant the steely eyes seemed to contemplate
her closer. "Many going away to-morrow?" he asked, as if to divert her
thoughts from the exciting experience of the evening before leaving
her.</p>

<p>"Only Captain Forsythe and--Mr. Steele."</p>

<p>Did he notice the slightest hesitation, on her part, before speaking the
last name? My lord's eyes fell; an odd expression appeared on his <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[pg 230]</span>face.
He murmured a few last perfunctory words; then--"They'll get him yet. He
can't get away," he repeated. The words had a singular, a sibilant sound;
he bowed deferentially and strode off, not toward his own chamber, however,
but toward the great stairway leading down to the first story.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her young mistress, the maid came quickly
forward. "Did you learn anything more, Miss Jocelyn, if I may be so bold as
to ask, from the police agent? Who the criminal was, or--"</p>

<p>"The police agent only said he was an ex-convict, no ordinary one, who
had escaped from London and was making for the sea. They got word he was at
the village and followed him there but he managed to elude them and they
traced him to Strathorn House park, where he had taken refuge. The police
did not acquaint Sir Charles, Lord Ronsdale or any one with their purpose,
thinking not to alarm us needlessly beforehand. And--I believe that is
all."</p>

<p>A moment the woman waited. "I--shall I--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[pg
231]</span>The girl looked before her; tiny flames from the grate
heightened the sheen on her gown; they threw passing lights on the somewhat
tired, proud face. "I shall not need you, Dobson," she said. "You may go. A
moment." The woman, who had half-turned, waited; Jocelyn's glance had
lowered to the fire; in its reflection her slim, delicate fingers were
rosy. She unclasped them, smoothed the brocade absently with one hand. "One
or two are leaving early to-morrow. You will see--you will give
instructions that everything is provided for their comfort."</p>

<p>The maid responded and left the room; Jocelyn stood as if wrapped in
reverie. At length she stirred suddenly and extinguishing all but one dim
light, sank back into a chair. Her eyes half closed, then shut entirely.
One might have thought her sleeping, except that her breathing was not deep
enough; the golden head remained motionless against the soft pink of the
dressing-gown; the hand that dropped limply from the white wrist over the
arm of the chair did not stir. Around, all was stillness; time passed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[pg
232]</span>then a faint shout from somewhere in the gardens, far off,
aroused her. The girl looked around; but immediately silence again reigned;
she got up.</p>

<p>Leaning against the shaft holding one of the marbles, she regarded
without seeing a chaste, youthful Canova, and beyond, painted on boards and
set against satin, a Botticelli face, spiritual, sphinx-like. Her brows
were slightly drawn; she breathed deeply now, as if there were something in
the place, its quiescence, the immobility of the lovely but ghost-like
semblance of faces with which it was peopled that oppressed her. She seemed
to be thinking, or questioning herself, when suddenly her attention was
attracted again by a sound of a different kind, or was it only fancy? She
looked toward a large Flemish tapestry covering one entire end of the room;
behind the antique landscape in green threads she knew there was a disused
door leading into armory hall. Drawing back the heavy folds she stepped a
little behind them; the door was locked and bolted; moreover, several heavy
nails had fastened it, completely isolating her suite, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[pg 233]</span>as it
were, from that spacious, general apartment.</p>

<p>Again the sound! This time she placed it--the creaking of the giant
branch of ivy that ran up and around her own balcony. The girl paused
irresolutely, her hand on the heavy ancient hanging. Leaning forward she
waited; but the noise stopped; she heard nothing more, told herself it was
nothing and was about to move out again when her gaze was suddenly held by
something that passed like a shadow--a man's arm?--on the other side of the
nearest window, between the modern French curtains, not quite drawn
together.</p>

<p>In that inconsiderable space between the silk fringes she was sure she
had seen it, and anything suggestive of <i>dolce far niente</i> disappeared
from the girl's blue eyes. The window opened wider, noiselessly but
quickly; then a hand, strong, shapely, pushed the curtains aside. Had the
intruder first satisfied himself that the room was vacant? He acted as one
certain of his ground; now drawing the window draperies quickly together
behind him as if seeking to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234"></a>[pg 234]</span>escape observation from any one below, he
stepped out into the room.</p>

<p>Something he saw seemed to surprise him; a low exclamation fell from his
lips; his eyes, searching in the dim light his surroundings, swiftly passed
from the rich furnishings, the artistic decorations, to the bright-colored
robe, the little slippers before the fire. Here they lingered, but only for
a moment! Did the intruder hear a sound, a quick breath? His gaze swerved
to the opposite end of the room where it saw a living presence. For a
moment they looked at each other; the man's face turned very pale; his hand
touched the back of a chair; he steadied himself.</p>

<p>"I thought--to enter armory hall--did not know your rooms were here," he
managed to say in a low tone, "at this corner of Strathorn House."</p>

<p>She did not answer; so they stood, silently, absurdly. Her face was like
paper; her hair, in contrast, most bright; her eyes expressed only
incomprehension. The man had to speak first; he pulled himself together.
The bad fortune <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235"></a>[pg 235]</span>that had dogged him so long, that he had
fought against so hard, now found its culmination: it had cast him, of all
places, hither, at her feet.</p>



<p class="figure"><a name="half004" href="images/half004.png"><img
width="40%" alt="Illustration: I had hoped you would never know Page 235"
src="images/half004.png" /></a><br />I had hoped you would never know Page
235</p>

<p>So be it; well, destiny now could harm him little more! His eyes
gleamed; a reckless light shone out, a daredevil luster. He continued to
look at her, then threw back his head.</p>

<p>"I had hoped you would never know; but the gods, it seems," he could
even laugh, "have ordained otherwise. '<i>Fata obstant</i>.'" Still that
startled, uncomprehending look on the girl's white face! He went on more
quickly, like a man driven to bay. "You do not understand; you are
credulous; take people for what they seem,--not for what they are; or have
been."</p>

<p>He stopped; a suggestion of pain creeping into her expression, as if,
behind wonderment, she was conscious of something being rudely torn,
wrenched in her inmost being, held him. His face grew set; the nails of his
closed fingers cut his palms. But the laugh returned to his lips, the
luster to his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[pg
236]</span>"Or have been!" he repeated. "A good many people have their
pasts. Can you imagine what mine may have been?"</p>

<p>But she scarcely followed his words; she did not think, she could not;
she seemed to stand in a hateful dream! Looking at him--the torn evening
clothes!--his face, pale, different! Listening to him!--to what--?</p>

<p>"A convict!" said the man. "Yes; that's what I was. Had been in jails,
jails! And was sent out of the country, years ago, transported. But time
went by and the convict thought he might safely come back--boldly--with
impunity. The years and--circumstances had altered him--wrought great
changes. He felt compelled to return--why, is of no moment!--believed
himself secure in so doing--and was--until chance led him out of his
accustomed way--to new walks--new faces--where lay the danger--the ambush,
into which he, who thought himself strong, like a weak fool, walked--or was
led--blindly." He caught himself up with a laugh. "But what is this to you?
Enough, the convict found <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237"></a>[pg 237]</span>himself recognized, his identity
thoroughly established."</p>

<p>He waited; still she was silent; the little hands clasped tightly the
heavy drapery that moved as if she were putting part of her weight on it.
Her expression showed still that she had not yet had time to comprehend;
that for her what he said remained, even now, but words, confused,
inexplicable. A strange sequel to a strange night, a night that had begun
with such gaiety and blitheness; that had been interrupted, after he had
left her, by the shouting and rough voices from the garden! She seemed to
hear them anew, and afterward, the explanation of that odd little person,
the police agent, his apologies for breaking in upon the cotillion. But he
had said--?</p>

<p>The blue eyes bent like stars now on this man in her room, standing
before her with bold, mocking face, as if his dark eyes read, understood
every thought that passed through her brain.</p>

<p>"You!--then it was you--John Steele--that they--"</p>

<p>"The convict they tried to arrest? Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[pg
238]</span>"You? I don't--" Her voice was almost childlike.</p>

<p>"I will help you to--understand!" An ashen shade came over his face, but
it passed quickly; his voice sounded brusk. "For months, since a fatal
evening all light, brilliancy, beauty!--the convict has been trying to hold
back the inevitable; but the net whose first meshes were then woven, has
since been drawing closer--closer. In the world two forces are ever at
work, the pursuers and the pursued. In this instance the former," harshly,
"were unusually clever. He struggled hard to keep up the deception until he
could complete a defense worthy of the name. But to no avail! He felt the
end near; did not expect it so soon, however, this night!--this very
night--!"</p>

<p>The man paused; there was a strange gleam in the dark eyes that lingered
on her; its light was succeeded by another, a fiercer expression. For the
first time she moved, shrank back slightly. "I'm afraid I used a few of
them roughly," he said with look derisory. "There was no time for soft
talk; it was cut and run--give <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239"></a>[pg 239]</span>'leg bail,' as the thieves say." Did he
purposely relapse into coarser words to clench home the whole damning,
detestable truth? Her fine soft lips quivered; it may be she felt herself
awakening--slowly; one hand pressed now at her breast. In the grate the
fire sank, although a few licking flames still thrust their fiery tongues
between black lumps of coal.</p>

<p>"But it was a close call, out there in the garden! They were before the
convict in the woods; he must needs double back to the shadow of the house!
At the bottom of a moat he looked up to a balcony overhead, small as
Juliet's---though I swear he thought it led to armory hall, not here; had
he known the truth, he would have stayed there first, and--But, as it was,
he heard voices around the corner; afar, men approaching. The ivy at
Strathorn House is almost as old as the house itself, the main branches
larger than a man's arm. It was not difficult to get here, though I wish
now--" he dared smile bitterly--"they had come on me first."</p>

<p>The breeze at the window slightly shook the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[pg 240]</span>curtain; it waved in and
out; the tassels struck faint taps on the sill.</p>

<p>"But why--?" she began at length, then stopped, as if the question were
gone almost as soon as it suggested itself.</p>

<p>"--did I return here,--reenter Strathorn House?" he completed it for
her. "Because there seemed nothing else to do; it was probably only
temporizing with the inevitable--but one always temporizes."</p>

<p>She moved slowly out into the room; his face was half-averted; all the
light that came from the grate, rested now on hers. At that instant she
seemed like a shadow, beautiful, but a shadow, going toward him as through
no volition of her own. The thick texture on the floor drowned the sound of
her steps; she paused with her fingers on the gilded frame of a settee. He
did not turn, although he must have known she was near; with his back
toward her he gazed down at the soft, bright hues of the rug, and on it a
white thing, a tiny bit of lace, a handkerchief that some time before had
fluttered to the floor and had been left lying there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[pg
241]</span>"But--" she spoke now--"you--you who seemed all that was--I
can't believe--it is impossible--inconceivable--"</p>

<p>His features twitched, the nerves seemed moving beneath the skin; but he
answered in a hard tone. "I have told you the truth; because," the words
broke from him, "I had to! Must I," despite himself there was an accent of
acutest pain in his voice, "repeat it?"</p>

<p>"No!" said the girl. "Oh, no."</p>

<p>"You guessed I was going away. I was going so that you might never learn
what you know now."</p>

<p>"I--guessed you were going? Ah, to-night--on the balcony!"</p>

<p>Did he divine what her words recalled, could not but bring to mind? A
tint sprang to her white face; it spread even to the white throat. The blue
eyes grew hard, very hard; the little hand he had so short a while before
held in his, closed; the slender figure which had then seemed to waver,
straightened. He read the thought his words had evoked, did not meet her
eyes now.</p>

<p>"You tell me what you have--And yet you <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[pg 242]</span>have come--dared to come
here--under this roof--?"</p>

<p>It may be she also recalled his look when first he had entered this
room, and, turning, had seen her; that her mind retained the impress of a
bearing, bold, mocking.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "it was infamous!"</p>

<p>The word struck him like a whip, lashed his face to a dull red; the
silence grew.</p>

<p>"I would not presume to dispute or to contradict any conclusion you may
have reached," he spoke at length in a low, even voice. "I had not, as I
said, intended this last, this most inexcusable intrusion. You have now
only one course to pursue--" His gaze turned to the long silken bell-rope
on the wall. "And I promise not to resist."</p>

<p>Her glance followed his, returned to his face, to his eyes, quietly
challenging. She took a step.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>She had suddenly stopped; in the hall voices were heard approaching; he
too caught them.</p>

<p>"That simplifies matters," he remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[pg
243]</span>Her breast stirred; she stood listening; they came nearer--now
were at the door. A measured knocking broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn!" The voice was that of Sir Charles. "Are you there?" She did
not answer. "Kindly unlock the door."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[pg
244]</span><hr />




<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2XIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><a name='AN_ANSWER'></a>AN ANSWER</h3>


<p>The girl made no motion to obey and the knocking was repeated;
mechanically she moved toward the threshold. "Yes?" All the color had left
her face. "What--what is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't mean to alarm you, my dear, but Mr. Gillett thinks the convict
might be concealing himself somewhere in the house; indeed, that it is
quite likely. So we are making a little tour of inspection. Shall we not go
through your rooms? There! don't be frightened!" quickly, "only as a matter
of precaution, you know."</p>

<p>"I," she seemed to catch her breath, "it is really quite unnecessary. I
have been through them myself."</p>

<p>"Might have known that!" with an attempt <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[pg 245]</span>at jocoseness. "But
thought we would make sure. Your balcony, you have looked there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well; lock your window leading to it. Only as a matter of
precaution," he repeated hastily. "No need of our coming in, I fancy. You
had retired?"</p>

<p>"I--was about to."</p>

<p>"Quite right." A moment the party lingered. "Shall I send one of the
maids to sleep in your dressing-room? Company, you know! Your voice sounds
a little nervous."</p>

<p>"Does it? Not at all!" she said hastily. "I am--not in the least
nervous."</p>

<p>"Good night, then!" They went. "One of my men in the garden felt sure he
had seen him return toward the house," Mr. Gillett's voice was wafted back,
became fainter, died away.</p>

<p>The man in the room stood motionless now, his face like that of a statue
save for the light and life of his eyes. The clock beat the moments; he
looked at her. The girl was almost turned from him; he saw more of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[pg
246]</span>bright hair than the pale profile, so still against the
delicately carved arabesques of the panel.</p>

<p>"The other way would have been--preferable!"</p>

<p>There was nothing reckless or bold in his bearing now; but, looking
away, she did not see. Was he tempted, if only in an infinitesimal degree,
to suggest a plea of mitigating circumstances--not for his own sake but for
hers; that she might feel less keenly that sense of hurt, of outraged
pride, for having smiled on him, admitted him to a certain frank, free
intimacy? Before the words fell from his lips, however, she turned; her
gaze arrested his purpose, made him feel poignantly, acutely, the distance
now between them. "What were you," she hesitated, emphasized over-sharply
the word, "transported for?"</p>

<p>An instant his eyes flashed suddenly back at her, as if he were on the
point of answering, telling her all, disavowing; but to what end? To ask
more of her than of others, throw himself on her generosity?</p>

<p>"What does it matter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[pg
247]</span>True; what did it matter to her; he had been in prisons before,
by his own words.</p>

<p>"Your name, of course, is not John Steele?"</p>

<p>He confessed it a purloined asset.</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>He looked at her--beyond! To a storm-tossed ship, a golden-haired child,
her curls in disorder, moving with difficulty, yet clinging so steadfastly
to a small cage. His name? It may be he heard again the loud pounding and
knocking; held her once more to his breast, felt the confiding, soft
arms.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" he repeated.</p>

<p>What, indeed? That which she had not been able to penetrate, to
understand in him, this was it! This!</p>

<p>"But why"--fragments of what he had said recurred to her; she spoke
mechanically--"when you found yourself recognized, did you not leave
England; why did you come here--to Strathorn House; incur the danger, the
risk?"</p>

<p>"Why?" He still continued to look straight before him. "Because
you--were here!" He spoke quietly, simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[pg
248]</span>"I?" she trembled.</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not fear!" quickly. "You!" a bitter smile crossed his
face. "One may see a star and long to draw nearer it, though one knows it
is always beyond reach, unattainable! May even stumble forward, led by its
light--bright, beautiful! Whither?" He laughed abruptly. "One has not
asked, nor cared."</p>

<p>"Cared?" Her figure swayed; he too stood uncertainly; the lights seemed
to tremble.</p>

<p>The man suddenly straightened; then turned. "And now," his voice sounded
harsh, tense; he stepped toward the balcony.</p>

<p>His words, the abrupt action--what it portended, aroused her.</p>

<p>"No; no!" The exclamation broke from her involuntarily; she seemed to
waken as from something unreal that had momentarily held her. "There--there
may be a safer way!" She hardly knew what she was saying; one thought alone
possessed her mind; she looked with strained, bright glance before her.
"The Queen Elizabeth staircase leading into the garden from my--" The words
were arrested; her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249"></a>[pg 249]</span>blue eyes, dark, dilated, lingered on him
in an odd, impersonal way. "Wait!" Bright spots of color now tinted her
cheeks; she went quickly toward the door she had left, her manner that of
one who hastens to some course on impulse, without pausing to reason. "A
few minutes!" She listened, turned the key; then opening the door, stepped
hastily out into the hall.</p>

<p>The latch clicked; the man stood alone. Whatever her purpose, only the
desire to act quickly, to have done with an intolerable situation moved
him. Once more he looked toward the window through which he had entered;
first, however, before going, he bethought himself of something, an answer
to one of her questions. She should find the answer after he was gone! His
fingers thrust themselves into a breast-pocket; he took out a small object,
wrapped in velvet. An instant his eyes rested upon it; then, stooping, he
picked up the bit of lace handkerchief from the floor and laying the dark
velvet against it placed the two on the table.</p>

<p>Would she understand? The debt he had felt <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[pg 250]</span>he owed her long before
to-night, that sense of obligation to the child who had reached out her
hand, in a different life, a different world! No; she had, of course,
forgotten; still he would leave it, that talisman so precious, which he had
cherished almost superstitiously.</p>

<p>When a few minutes later the girl hastily re&euml;ntered the room, she
carried on her arm a man's coat and hat; her appearance was feverish, her
eyes wide and shining.</p>

<p>"Your clothes are torn--would attract attention! These were on the
rack--I don't know whose--but I stole them!--stole them!"</p>

<p>She spoke quickly with a little hard note of self-mockery. Her voice
broke off suddenly; she looked around her.</p>

<p>The coat and hat slipped from her arm; she looked at the window; the
curtain still moved, as if a hand had but recently touched it. She stared
at it--incredulously. He had gone; he would have none of her assistance
then; preferred--She listened, but caught only the rustling of the heavy
silk. When? Minutes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
id="Page_251"></a>[pg 251]</span>passed; at her left, a candle, carelessly
adjusted by the maid, dripped to the dresser; its over-long wick threw
weird, ever-changing shadows; her own silhouette appeared in various
distorted forms on hangings and wall.</p>

<p>Still she heard nothing, nothing louder than the faint sounds at the
window; the occasional, mysterious creakings of old woodwork. He must have
long since reached the ground--the bottom of the old moat; perhaps, as the
police agent and several of his men were in the house, he might even have
attained the fringe of the wood. It was not so far distant,--the space
intervening from the top of the moat contained many shrubs; in their
friendly shadows--</p>

<p>She stole to the corner of the window now and cautiously peered out. The
sky was overcast; below, faint markings could just be discerned; beyond,
Cimmerian gloom--Strathorn wood.</p>

<p>Had he reached, could he reach it? A cool breeze fanned her cheeks
without lessening the flush that burned there; her lips were half-parted.
She stepped uncertainly back; a reaction swept over her; the most trivial
thoughts <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[pg
252]</span>came to mind. She remembered that she had not locked the door of
her boudoir; that Sir Charles had told her to do so. She almost started to
obey; but laughed nervously instead. How absurd! What, however, should she
do? She looked toward the next room. Go to bed? It seemed the commonplace,
natural conclusion, and, after all, life was very commonplace. But the coat
and hat she had brought there? Consideration of them, also, came within the
scope of the commonplace.</p>

<p>It did not take her long to dispose of them, not on the rack, however.
Standing again, a few moments later, at the head of the stairway, in the
upper hall, she heard voices approaching. Whereupon she quickly dropped
both hat and coat on a chair near-by and fled to her room.</p>

<p>None too soon! From above footsteps were descending; people now passed
by; they evidently had been searching the third story. She could hear their
low, dissatisfied voices; the last persons to come she at once recognized
by their tones.</p>

<p>"You have made a bungling job of it," said <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[pg 253]</span>Lord Ronsdale. There was a
suppressed fierce bitterness in his accents, which, however, in the
excitement of the moment, the girl failed to notice.</p>

<p>"He had made up his mind not to be taken alive, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Then--" The other interrupted Mr. Gillett harshly, but she failed to
catch more of his words.</p>

<p>"We've not lost him, my Lord," Mr. Gillett spoke again. "If he's not in
the house, he's near it, in the garden, and we have every way guarded."</p>

<p>"Every way guarded!" The girl drew her breath; as they disappeared, the
striking of the clock caused her to start. One! two! About four hours of
darkness, hardly that long remained for him! And yet she would have
supposed it later; it had been after one o'clock when she had come to her
room.</p>

<p>She became aware of a throbbing in her head, a dull pain, and
mechanically seating herself near one of the tables, she put up her hand
and started to draw the pins from her hair, but <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[pg 254]</span>soon desisted. Again she
began to think, more clearly this time, more poignantly, of all she had
experienced--listened to--that night!</p>

<p>She, a Wray, sprung from a long line of proud, illustrious folk! And he?
The breath of the roses outside was wafted upward; her eyes, deep,
self-scoffing, rested, without seeing, on a small dark object on a
handkerchief on the table. What was it to her if they took him?--What
indeed? Her fingers played with the object, closed hard on it. Why should
she care if he paid the penalty; he, a self-confessed---</p>

<p>Something fell from the velvet covering in her hand and struck with a
musical sound on the hard, polished top. Amid a turmoil of thoughts, she
was vaguely aware of it gleaming there on the cold white marble, a small
disk--a gold coin. At first it seemed only to catch without interesting her
glance; then slowly she took it, as if asking herself how it came there, on
her handkerchief, which, she dimly remembered, had been lying on the floor.
Some one, of course, must have picked up the handkerchief; but no <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[pg 255]</span>one had
been in the room since she had noticed it except--</p>

<p>Her gaze swung to the window; he, then, had left it. Why? What had she
to do with anything that had been his?</p>

<p>More closely she scrutinized it, the shining disk on her rosy palm; a
King George gold piece! Above the monarch's face and head with its flowing
locks, appeared a tiny hole, as if some one had once worn it; beneath, just
discernible, was the date, 1762. She continued to regard it; then looked
again at the bit of velvet, near-by. It had been wrapped in that,
carefully; for what reason? Like something more than what it seemed--a mere
gold piece!</p>

<p>"1762." Why, even as she gazed at the cloth, felt it, did the figures
seem to reiterate themselves in her brain? "1762." There could be nothing
especially significant about the date; yet even as she concluded thus, by
some introspective process she saw herself bending over, studying those
figures on another occasion. Herself--and yet--</p>

<p>She was looking straight before her now; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[pg 256]</span>suddenly she started and
sprang up. "A King George gold piece!" Her hair, unbound, fell around her,
below her waist; her eyes like sapphires, gazed out from a veritable
shimmer of gold. "Date--" She paused. "Why, this belonged to me once, as a
child, and I--"</p>

<p>The blue eyes seemed searching--searching; abruptly she found what she
sought. "I gave it to the convict on the <i>Lord Nelson</i>." She almost
whispered the words. "The brave, brave fellow who sacrificed his life for
mine." Her warm fingers closed softly on the coin; she seemed wrapped in
the picture thus recalled.</p>

<p>"Then how--" Her brows knitted, she swept the shining hair from her
face. "If he were drowned, how could it have been left here by--" Her eyes
were dark now with excitement. "Him? Him?" she repeated. "Unless," her
breast suddenly heaved--"he was not drowned, after all; he--"</p>

<p>A sudden shot from the park rang out; the coin fell from the girl's
hand; other shots followed. She ran out upon the balcony, a stifled cry on
her lips; she stared off, but only the darkness met her gaze.</p>

<p>Not far from one of the entrances to Regent's Park or the hum of Camden
Town's main artery of traffic, lay a little winding street which, because
of its curving lines, had long been known as Spiral Row. Although many
would not deign in passing to glance twice down this modest thoroughfare,
it presented, nevertheless, a romantic air of charm and mystery. The houses
nestled timidly behind time-worn walls; it was always very quiet within
this limited precinct, and one wondered sometimes, by day, if the various
secluded abodes were really inhabited, and by whom? An actress, said vague
rumor; a few scribblers, a pair of painters, a military man or two. Here
Madam Grundy never ventured, but Calliope and the tuneful nine were
understood to be occasional callers. One who once lived in the Row <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[pg 258]</span>has
likened it to a tiny Utopia where each and every one minded his own
business and where the comings and goings of one's neighbor were matters of
indifference.</p>

<p>Into this delectable byway there turned, late in the night of the second
day after that memorable evening at Strathorn House, a man who, looking
quickly around him, paused before the closed gate of one of the dwellings.
The street, ever a quiet one, appeared at that advanced hour absolutely
deserted, and, after a moment's hesitation, the man pulled the bell; for
some time he waited; but no response came. He looked in; through the
shrubbery he could dimly make out the house, set well back, and in a half
uncertain way he stood staring at it, when from the end of the street, he
heard a vehicle coming rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>More firmly the man jerked at the handle of the bell; this time his
efforts were successful; a glimmer as from a candle appeared at the front
door, and a few minutes later a dark form came slowly down the graveled
walk. As it approached the vehicle also drew nearer; the man <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[pg
259]</span>regarded the latter sidewise; now it was opposite him, and he
turned his back quickly to the flare of its lamps. But in a moment it had
whirled by, with a note of laughter from its occupants, light pleasure
seekers; at the same time a key turned in a lock and the gate swung
open.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Dennis," said the caller. The faint gleam of the candle
revealed the drowsy and unmistakably Celtic face of him he addressed, a man
past middle age, who regarded the new-comer with a look of recognition.
"I'm afraid I've interrupted your slumbers. This is rather a late hour at
which to arrive."</p>

<p>"No matter, sir. Sure and I sat up expecting you, Mr. Steele, until
after midnight, and had only just turned in when--"</p>

<p>"What--?" The new-comer, now fairly within the garden, could not
suppress a start of surprise, which however the other, engaged in relocking
the gate, did not appear to notice. "Expecting--?"</p>

<p>"Although I'd given up thinking you'd be here to-night," the latter went
on. "But won't you be stepping in, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[pg
260]</span>The other silently followed, walking in the manner of one tired
and worn; he did not, however, at that moment seem concerned with fatigue
or physical discomfort; the uncertain light of the candle before him showed
his brows drawn, his eyes questioning, as if something had happened to
cause him to think deeply, doubtfully. At the door the servant stood aside
to allow him to enter; then ushered him into a fairly commodious and
comfortable sitting-room.</p>

<p>"My master did not come back with you, sir, from Strathorn House?"</p>

<p>"No; Captain Forsythe's gone on to Germany."</p>

<p>"To attend some court, I suppose. Sure, 'tis a dale he has done of that,
Mr. Steele, after the both of us were wounded by those black devils in
India and retired from active service." The servant's voice had an
inquiring accent; his glance rested now in some surprise on the new-comer's
garments,--a gamekeeper's well-worn coat and cap,--and on the dusty, almost
shabby-looking shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[pg
261]</span>"A wager," said John Steele, noting the old orderly's
expression. "From Strathorn House to London by foot, within a given time,
don't you know; fell in with some rough customers last night who thought my
coat and hat better than these."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but--" The man's apprehensive look fastened
itself on a dark stain on the coat, near the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Just winged me--a scratch," replied John Steele with an indifferent
shrug, sinking into a chair near the fire which burned low.</p>

<p>"It's lucky you came off no worse, sir, and you'll be finding a change
of garments up-stairs; I put them out for you myself--"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Dennis, I'm rather large for your master's clothes," was
the visitor's reply in a voice that he strove vainly to make light.</p>

<p>"Sure, they're your own, sir." The other looked up quickly. "I'll get
everything ready for a bath, and if you've a mind for anything to eat
afterward--"</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a little of the last, first," said the visitor
slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[pg
262]</span>"Right you are, sir. You do look a bit done up, sir,"
sympathetically, "but there's a veal and 'ammer in the cupboard that will
soon make you fit."</p>

<p>"One moment, Dennis." John Steele leaned back; the dying embers revealed
a haggard face; his eyes half closed as if from lack of sleep but
immediately opened again. "You spoke of expecting me; how," he stretched
out his legs, "did you know--?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sir, by your luggage; it arrived with my master's heavier boxes
that he didn't take along with him over the wather." The listener did not
stir; was he too weary to experience surprise or even deeper emotion?</p>

<p>His luggage there!--where no one knew--could have known, he was going!
The place he had selected, under what he had considered propitious
circumstances, as a haven, a refuge; where he might find himself for a
brief period comparatively safe, could he reach it, turn in, without being
detected! This last he believed he had successfully accomplished; and then
to be told by the man--All John Steele's excuses <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[pg 263]</span>for coming in this
unceremonious fashion that he had planned to put to the servant of Captain
Forsythe were at the moment forgotten. Who could have guessed that he would
make his way straight hither--or had any one? An enemy, divining a lurking
place for which he was heading, would not have obligingly forwarded his
belongings. What then? Had Jocelyn Wray ordered them sent on with Captain
Forsythe's boxes and bags, in order that they might be less likely to fall
into the hands of the police?</p>

<p>This line of reasoning seemed to lead into most unwonted channels; it
was not probable she would concern herself so much further about a common
fugitive. The cut and bruised fingers of the man before the fireplace
linked and unlinked; an indefinable feeling of new dangers he had not
calculated on assailed him. Suppose the police should have learned--should
elect to trace, those articles of his? It was a contingency, a hazard to be
considered; he knew that every possible effort would be made to find him;
that if his antagonists were eager before, they would embark on the present
quest with redoubled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264"
id="Page_264"></a>[pg 264]</span>zeal. He had been in their hands and had
got away; disappointment would drive them more fiercely on to employ every
expedient. They might even now be at the gate; at the moment, however, he
felt as if he hardly cared, only that he was very tired, too exhausted to
move on. His exertions of the last few days had been of no ordinary kind;
his shoulder was stiff and it pained.</p>

<p>"Here you are, sir." The servant had entered and re&euml;ntered, had set
the table without the man in the arm-chair being conscious of his coming
and going. "Remembered my master inviting you once, when you were here, to
pitch your camp at Rosemary Villa any time you should be after yearning for
that quietood essential for literary composition and to windin' up the
campaign on your book. So when I saw your luggage--"</p>

<p>"Exactly." It was curious the man should have spoken thus, should have
voiced one of the very subterfuges Steele had had in mind himself to utter,
to show pretext for his too abrupt appearance. But now--?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[pg
265]</span>The situation was changed; yet he felt too exhausted to disavow
the servant's conclusion. Certainly the episode of the luggage had made his
task easier at this point; only, however, to enhance the greater hazards,
as if fate were again laughing at him, offering him too much ease, too
great comfort, seeking to allure him with a false estimate of his security.
As he ate, mechanically, but with the zest of one who had long fasted, he
listened; again a vehicle went by; then another.</p>

<p>"Rather livelier than usual to-night?" he observed and received an
affirmative answer. Some evenings now you'd hardly ever hear anything
passing from sunset to sunrise and find it as quiet as the tomb.</p>

<p>Who lived on the right, on the left? The visitor asked several questions
casually; the house to the right, the man thought, might be vacant; no one
appeared to live in it very long. At least the moving van seemed to have
acquired a habit of stopping there; the one on the left had a more stable
tenant; a lady who appeared in the pantomime, or the opera, he wasn't sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[pg
266]</span>which,--only, foreign people sometimes went in and out.</p>

<p>John Steele rose with an effort; no, there was nothing more he required,
except rest! Which room would he prefer, he was asked when he found himself
on the upper landing; the man had put his things in a front chamber; but
the back one was larger. John Steele forced himself to consider; he even
inspected both of the rooms; that on the front floor had one window facing
the Row; the second chamber looked out over a rear wall separating the
vegetable garden of Rosemary Villa from the shrub-adorned confines of a
place which fronted on the next street.</p>

<p>The visitor decided on the former chamber; he carefully closed the
blinds and drew across the window the dark, heavy curtains. This would
answer very well; excellent accommodations for a man whose own chambers in
the city were now in the hands of renovators--the painters, the
paper-hangers, the plumbers. And the back room? He paused, as if
considering the servant's assumption of his purpose in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[pg 267]</span>coming
hither. He might as well let the fellow think--</p>

<p>Yes, he would venture to make use of that for his work; could thus take
advantage of the force of circumstances that had arisen to alienate him
from prosaic citations, writs or arraignments. But he must, with strained
lightness, emphasize one point; for a brief spell he did not wish to be
disturbed. People might call; people probably would, anxious clients,
almost impossible to get rid of, unless--</p>

<p>No one must know where he was, under any circumstances; his voice
sounded almost jocular, at singular variance with the heaviness, the
weariness of his face. He, the old servant, had been a soldier; knew how to
fulfil, then, a request or an order. Something crinkled in the speaker's
hand, passed to the other who was now busying himself with the bath; the
man's moist fingers did not hesitate to close on the note. He had been a
hardened campaigner and incidentally a good forager; he remarked at once he
would carry out to the letter all his master's visitor asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[pg
268]</span>Half an hour later, John Steele, clad in his dressing-gown, sat
alone near the fire in his room; every sound had ceased save at intervals a
low creaking of old timber. Now it came from overhead, then from the hall
or near the window, as if spirit feet or fingers were busy in that
venerable, quaint domicile. But these faint noises, inseparable from houses
with a history, John Steele did not hear; the food and the bath had
awakened in him a momentary alertness; he seemed waiting--for what?
Something that did not happen; heaviness, depression again weighed on him;
to keep awake he stirred himself and again glanced about. Here were
evidences of odd taste on the part of the tenant in the matter of household
decoration; a chain and ball that had once been worn by a certain famous
convict reposed on an <i>&eacute;tag&egrave;re</i>, instead of the
customary vase or jug of pottery; other souvenirs of prisons and the people
that had been in them adorned a few shelves and brackets.</p>

<p>John Steele smiled grimly; but soon his thoughts seemed floating off
beyond control, and rising suddenly, he threw himself on the bed. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[pg 269]</span>For a
moment he strove to consider one or two tasks that should have been
accomplished this night but which he must defer; was vaguely conscious of
the slamming of a blind next door; then over-strained nature yielded.</p>

<p>Hours passed; the sun rose high in the heavens, began to sink; still the
heavy sleep of utter exhaustion claimed him. Once or twice the servant came
to the door, listened, and stole away again. The afternoon was well
advanced when, as half through a dream, John Steele heard the rude jingling
of a bell,--the catmeat man, or the milkman, drowsily he told himself. In
fancy he seemed to see the broad, flowing river from a window of his own
chambers, the dawn stealing over, marshaling its tints,--crimson
until--</p>

<p>Slowly through the torpor of his brain realization began also to dawn;
this room?--it was not his. The gleaming lances of sunlight that darted
through the half-closed shutters played on the strange wall-paper of a
strange apartment; no, he remembered it now--last night!</p>

<p>The loud and emphatic closing of the front <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[pg 270]</span>gate served yet more
speedily to arouse him; hastily he sat up; his head buzzed from a
long-needed sleep that had been over sound; his limbs still ached, but
every sense on an instant became unnaturally keen. Footsteps resounded on
the gravel; he heard voices; those of two men, who were coming toward the
house.</p>

<p>"So it's the meter man you are?" John Steele recognized the inquiring
voice as that of the caretaker. "Sure, you're a new one from the last that
was here."</p>

<p>"Yes; we change beats occasionally," was the careless answer, as the men
passed around the side of the house and entered a rear door. For a time
there was silence; John Steele sprang from his bed and crept very softly
toward the hall. "A new man--" He heard them talking again after a few
minutes; he remained listening at his door, now slightly ajar.</p>

<p>"There must be a leak somewhere from the quantity you've burned. I'll
have a look around; might save your master a few shillings."</p>

<p>The man moved from room to room and started, at length, up the stairs.
John Steele <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[pg
271]</span>closed and noiselessly locked his door; the "meter man" crossed
the upper hall and stepped, one after the other, into the several rooms.
Having apparently made there the necessary examination, he walked over and
tried the door of John Steele's room.</p>

<p>"This room's occupied by a visitor," interposed the servant quickly in a
hushed voice. "And he's asleep now; he wouldn't thank you for the
disturbing of his repose."</p>

<p>"All right." Did the listener detect an accent of covert satisfaction in
the caller's low tones? "I'll not wake him. Don't find the leak I was
looking for; will drop in again, though, when I have more time."</p>

<p>Their footsteps receded and shortly afterward, the man left the house;
as he did so, John Steele, pushing back the blinds a little, looked out of
his room; the man who had reached the front of the place glanced back. His
gaze at that instant, meeting the other's, seemed to betray a momentary
eagerness; quickly Steele turned away; no doubt now lingered in his mind as
to the purpose of the visit.</p>

<h3><a name='FLIGHT'></a>FLIGHT</h3>


<p>The half-expected had happened; bag and baggage had led his pursuers
hither; the fellow could now go back and report. After his bath, before
lying down, John Steele had partly dressed in the garments laid out for
him; now he threw the dressing-gown from his shoulders and hastily put on
the rest of his clothes. He felt now only the need for action--to do what?
Impatience was capped by the realization of his own impotence; Rosemary
Villa was, no doubt, at that very moment, subjected to a close espionage.
He heard the man-servant in the garden, and unable to restrain a growing
restlessness to know the worst, Steele mounted the stairs to the attic.</p>

<p>From the high window there he could see, around a curve in the Row, a
loitering figure; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273"
id="Page_273"></a>[pg 273]</span>in the other direction a neighboring house
concealed the byway, but he could reasonably conclude that some one also
sauntered there, sentinel at that end of the street. Quickly coming down to
the second story, he began cautiously to examine from the windows the
situation of the house, in relation to adjoining grounds and neighboring
dwellings.</p>

<p>To the right, the top of the high wall shone with the customary broken
bits of glass; the rear defenses glistened also in formidable fashion. He
noted, however, several places where this safeguard against unwonted
invasion showed signs of deterioration; in one or two spots the jagged
fragments had been broken, or had fallen off. These slight breaks in the
continuity of irregular, menacing glass bits, he fixed in mind by a certain
shrub or tree. Against the rear wall, which was of considerable height,
leaned his neighbor's low conservatory, almost spanning it from side to
side.</p>

<p>"Sure, sir, I don't know whether it's breakfast or supper that's waiting
for you." Captain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274"
id="Page_274"></a>[pg 274]</span>Forsythe's man had reappeared and stood
now at the top of the landing looking in at him. "It's a sound sleep you've
had."</p>

<p>John Steele glanced at the clock; the afternoon was waning. Why did not
his enemies force their way in, surround him at once? Unless--and this
might prove a momentary saving clause!--these people without were but an
advance guard, an outpost, awaiting orders. In this event Gillett would
hastily be sent for; would soon be on his way---</p>

<p>"'Tis a rasher of real Irish bacon that is awaiting your convenience,
sir."</p>

<p>The servant was now eying the visitor dubiously; John Steele wheeled, a
perfunctory answer on his lips, and going to the dining-room swallowed
hastily a few mouthfuls. From where he sat he could command a view of the
front gate, and kept glancing toward it when alone. To go now,--or wait?
The daylight did not favor the former course unless his pursuers should
suddenly appear before the locked gate, demanding admission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[pg
275]</span>He made up his mind as to his course then, the last desperate
shift. Amid a turmoil of thoughts a certain letter he had had in mind to
send to Captain Forsythe occurred to him, and calling for paper and pen, he
wrote there, facing the window, feverishly, hastily, several pages; then he
gave the letter to the servant for the postman, whose special call at the
iron knocker without had just sounded. The letter would have served John
Steele ill had it fallen into his enemies' hands, but once in the care of
the royal mails it would be safe. If it were, indeed, that person at the
gate, and not some one--</p>

<p>"One moment, Dennis!" The man paused. "Of course you will make sure it
is the postman--?"</p>

<p>The servant stared at this guest whose demeanor was becoming more and
more eccentric. "As if I didn't know his knock!" he said, departing.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned; the shadows began to fall; John Steele's pulses now
throbbed expectantly. He called for a key to the gate and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[pg 276]</span>moved
toward the front door; by this time the darkness had deepened, and, key in
hand, he stepped out.</p>

<p>At first he walked toward the front on the gravel that the servant might
hear him, but near the entrance he paused, hesitating, to look out. As he
remained thus, some one, who had been standing not far off, drew near. This
person steathily passed; in doing so he glanced around; but John Steele
felt uncertain whether the fellow had or had not been able to distinguish
him in the gloom. John Steele waited, however, until the other moved a
short distance on; then he retraced his own way quietly, keeping to the
grass, toward the house; near it he swerved and in the same rapid manner
stole around the place until he reached the back wall.</p>

<p>There he examined his position, felt the top, then placed his fingers on
the wall. It was about six feet high, but seizing hold, he was about to
spring into the air, when behind him, from the direction of the Row, a low
metallic sound caught his attention. The front gate to the Forsythe house
had suddenly clicked; some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277"></a>[pg 277]</span>one had entered,--not the servant; John
Steele had seen him but a few moments before in the kitchen; some one,
then, who had quietly picked the lock, as the surest way of getting in.</p>

<p>John Steele looked back; even as he did so, a number of figures abruptly
ran forward from the gate. He waited no longer but drew himself up to a
level with the top of the wall. The effort made him acutely aware of his
wounded shoulder; he winced but set his teeth hard and swung himself over
until one foot came in contact with the iron frame of the greenhouse next
to the masonry. To crawl to the end of the lean-to, bending to hold to the
wall, and then to let himself down, occupied but a brief interval.</p>

<p>As he stood there, trying to make out a path through shrubs and trees,
he heard behind him an imperative knocking at the front door of Captain
Forsythe's house; the expostulating tones of the serving-man; the
half-indistinct replies that were succeeded by the noise of feet hastening
into the house.</p>

<p>For some time nothing save these sounds was wafted to the listener; then
a loud disappointed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278"
id="Page_278"></a>[pg 278]</span>voice, sounding above another voice, came
from a half-opened window. John Steele stood still no longer; great hazard,
almost certain capture, lay before him in the direction he was going; the
street this garden led to would be watched; but he could not remain where
he was. Already his enemies were moving about in the neighboring grounds;
soon they would flash their lights over the wall, would discover him,
unless--He moved quickly forward. As he neared the house, more imposing
than Captain Forsythe's, a stream of light poured from a window; through
this bright space he darted quickly, catching a fleeting view of people
within, several with their faces turned toward him. Close to a side of the
square-looking house, he paused, his heart beating fast--not with fear, but
with a sudden, fierce anger at the possibility that he would be caught
thus; no better than a mere--</p>

<p>But needs must, when the devil drives; the devil was driving him now
hard. To attempt to reach the gate, to get out to Surrey Road,--little
doubt existed as to what awaited him there; so, crouching low, he forced
himself to linger a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279"
id="Page_279"></a>[pg 279]</span>little longer where he was. As thus he
remained motionless, sharp twinges again shot through his shoulder; then,
on a sudden, he became unmindful of physical discomfort; a plan of action
that had flashed through his brain, held him oblivious to all else; it
offered only the remotest chance of escape--but still a chance, which he
weighed, determined to take! It had come to him while listening to the
merry voices within the room near him talking of the gay dinner just ended,
of the box party at the theater that was to follow.</p>

<p>Already cabs were at the door; the women and the men, several of the
latter flushed with wine, were ready to go. A servant walked out and
unlocked the gate and with light badinage the company issued forth. As they
did so, John Steele, unobserved, stepped forward; in the semi-darkness the
party passed through the entrance into the street. Taking his place among
the last of the laughing, dimly-seen figures, John Steele walked boldly on
and found himself a moment later on the sidewalk of Surrey Road. He was
aware that some one, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"
id="Page_280"></a>[pg 280]</span>woman, had touched his arm, as if to take
it; of a light feminine voice and an abrupt exclamation of surprise, of the
quick drawing back of fluttering skirts. But he did not stop to apologize
or to explain; walking swiftly to one of the last cabs he sprang in.</p>

<p>"A little errand first, driver," he called out. "To--" and mentioned a
street--"as fast as you can." His tone was sharp, authoritative; it implied
the need for instant obedience, rang like a command. The man straightened,
touched his horse with his whip, and wheeling quickly they dashed away.</p>

<p>As they did so, John Steele thought he heard exclamations behind;
looking through the cab window he saw, at the gate, the company gazing
after him, obviously not yet recovered from their thrill of surprise
following his unexpected action. He observed, also, two men on the other
side of the street who now ran across and held a brief altercation with one
of the cabmen. As they were about to enter the cab several persons in the
party apparently intervened, expostulating vigorously. It was not difficult
to surmise <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[pg
281]</span>the resentment of the group at this attempted summary seizure of
a second one of their cabs. By the time the men had explained their
imperative need, and after further argument were permitted to drive off,
John Steele had gained a better start than he had dared to hope. But they
would soon be after him, post-haste; yes, already they were dashing hard
and furiously behind; he lifted the lid overhead, in his hand a
sovereign.</p>

<p>"Those men must not overtake us, cabby. Go where you will! You
understand?"</p>

<p>The man did; his fingers closed quickly on the generous tip and once
more he lashed his horse. For some time they continued at a rapid pace, now
skirting the confines of the park, now plunging into a puzzling tangle of
streets; but wherever they went, the other cab managed always to keep them
in sight. It even began to creep up, nearer. From his pocket John Steele
drew a weapon; his eyes gleamed ominously. The pursuing hansom drew closer;
casting a hurried glance over his shoulder, he again called up to the
driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[pg
282]</span>"It's no use, gov'ner," came back the reply. "This 'oss 'as been
out longer than 'is."</p>

<p>"Then turn the first dark corner and slow up a bit,--for only a second;
afterward, go on your very best as long as you can."</p>

<p>Another sovereign changed hands and shortly afterward the vehicle dashed
into a side street. It appeared as likely a place as any for his purpose;
John Steele, hardly waiting for the man to draw rein, leaped out as far as
he might. He landed without mishap, heard a whip snap furiously, and darted
back into a doorway. He had just reached it when the other cab drew near;
for an instant he felt certain that he had been seen; but the pursuers'
eyes were bent eagerly ahead.</p>

<p>"This'll mean a fiver for you, my man," he heard one of them shout to
the driver. "We've got him, by--" A harsh, jubilant cry cut the air; then
they were gone.</p>

<p>John Steele did not wait; replacing the weapon in his pocket he started
quickly around the corner; his cabman could not lead them far; they would
soon return. As fast as possible, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283"></a>[pg 283]</span>without attracting undue attention, he
retraced his way; passed in and out of tortuous thoroughfares; by shops
from whence came the smell of frying fish; down alleys where squalor
lurked. Although he had by this time, perhaps, eluded the occupants of the
cab, he knew there were others keenly alert for his capture whom he might
at any moment encounter. To his fancy every corner teemed with peril; he
did not underestimate the resources of those who sought him or the cunning
of him who was the chief among his enemies.</p>

<p>Which way should he move? At that moment the city's multitudinous blocks
seemed like the many squares of an oriental checker-board; the problem he
put to himself was how to cross the city and reach the vicinity of the
river; there to make a final effort to look for--What? A hopeless
quest!</p>

<p>His face burned with fever; he did not heed it. A long, broad
thoroughfare, as he walked on, had suddenly unfolded itself to his gaze;
one side of this highway shone resplendent with the flaring lights of
numerous stands and stalls <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284"
id="Page_284"></a>[pg 284]</span>displaying vegetables and miscellaneous
articles. A hubbub assailed the ear, the voices of hucksters and hawkers,
vying with one another to dispose of their wares; like ants, people
thronged the sidewalk and pavement near these temporary booths.</p>

<p>About to turn back from this animated scene, John Steele hesitated; the
road ran straight and sure toward the destination he wished to reach, while
on either hand lay a network of devious ways. Amid these labyrinths, even
one familiar with the city's maze might go astray, and again he glanced
down the single main road, cutting squarely through all intricacies; noted
that although, on one side, the lamps and the torches flared high,
revealing every detail of merchandise, and, incidentally, the faces of all
who passed, the other side of the thoroughfare seemed the more murky and
shadowy by comparison.</p>

<p>He decided, crossed the street; lights gleamed in his face. He pushed
his way through the people unmolested and strode on, followed only by the
noise of passing vehicles and carts; then <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[pg 285]</span>found himself walking on
the other side, apart from the headlong busy stream. A suspicion of mist
hung over the city; through it, people afar assumed shapes unreal; above
the jagged sky-line of housetops the heavens had taken on that sickly hue,
the high dome's jaundiced aspect for London in autumn.</p>

<p>On!--on! John Steele moved; on!--on!--the traffic pounded, for the most
part in the opposite direction; a vast, never-ending source of sound, it
seemed to soothe momentarily his sense of insecurity. Time passed; he had,
apparently, evaded his pursuers; he told himself he might, after all, meet
the problem confronting him; meet and conquer. It would be a hard battle;
but once in that part of the city he was striving to reach, he might find
those willing to offer him shelter--low-born, miserable wretches he had
helped. He would not disdain their succor; the end justified the way. In
their midst, if anywhere in London, was the one man in the world who could
throw a true light on the events of the past; enable him to---</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[pg
286]</span>Behind him some one followed; some one who drew ever nearer,
with soft, skulking steps which now he heard--</p>

<p>"Mr. Steele!" Even as he wheeled, his name was called out.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[pg

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2XVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><a name='THE_UNEXPECTED'></a>THE UNEXPECTED</h3>


<p>Before the sudden fierce passion gleaming on John Steele's face, the
bright flame of his look, the person who had accosted him shrank back; his
pinched and pale face showed surprise, fear; almost incoherently he began
to stammer. Steele's arm had half raised; it now fell to his side; his eyes
continued to study, with swift, piercing glance, the man who had called. He
was not a fear-inspiring object; hunger and privation seemed so to have
gripped him that now he presented but a pitiable shadow of himself.</p>

<p>Did John Steele notice that changed, abject aspect, that bearing, devoid
totally of confidence? All pretense of a certain coster smartness that he
remembered, had vanished; the hair, once curled with cheap jauntiness, hung
now straight and straggling; a tawdry ornament <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[pg 288]</span>which had stood out in the
past, absurdly distinct on a bright cravat, with many other details that
had served to build up a definite type of individual, seemed to have
dropped off into oblivion.</p>

<p>Steele looked about; they two, as far as he could see, were alone. He
regarded the man again; it was very strange, as if a circular stage, the
buskined world's tragic-comic wheel of fortune, had turned, and a person
whom he had seen in one character had reappeared in another.</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon." The fellow found his voice. "I'll not be troubling
you further, Mr. Steele."</p>

<p>The other's expression altered; he could have laughed; he had been
prepared for almost anything, but not this. The man's tones were hopeless;
very deferential, however.</p>

<p>"You were about to beg--of me?" John Steele smiled, as if, despite his
own danger, despite his physical pangs, he found the scene odd, unexampled,
between this man and himself--this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289"
id="Page_289"></a>[pg 289]</span>man, a sorry vagrant; himself, become now
but a--"You were about to--?"</p>

<p>"I had, sir, so far forgotten myself as to venture to think of applying
for temporary assistance; however--" Dandy Joe began to shuffle off in a
spiritless way, when--</p>

<p>"You are hungry?" said John Steele.</p>

<p>"A little, sir."</p>

<p>"A modest answer in view of the actual truth, I suspect," observed the
other. But although his words were brusk, he felt in his pocket; a
sovereign--it was all he had left about him. When he had departed
post-haste for Strathorn House, he had neglected to furnish himself with
funds for an indefinite period; a contingency he should have foreseen had
risen; for the present he could not appear at the bank to draw against the
balance he always maintained there. His own future, how he should be able
to subsist, even if he could evade those who sought him, had thus become
problematical. John Steele fingered that last sovereign; started to turn,
when he caught the look in the other's <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[pg 290]</span>eyes. Did it recall to him
his own plight but a short twenty-four hours before?</p>

<p>"Very well!" he said, and was about to give the coin to the man and walk
away, when another thought held him.</p>

<p>This fellow had been a link in a certain chain of events; the temptation
grew to linger with him, the single, tangible, though paltry and useless,
figure in the drama he could lay hands on. John Steele looked around; in a
byway he saw the lighted window of a cheap oyster buffet. It appeared a
place where they were not likely to be interrupted, and motioning to the
man, he wheeled abruptly and started for it.</p>

<p>A few minutes later found them seated in the shabby back room; a number
of faded sporting pictures adorned the wall; one--how John Steele
started!--showed the 'Frisco Pet in a favorite attitude. Absorbed in
studying it, he hardly heard the proprietor of the place, and it was Joe
who first answered him; he had the honor of being asked there by this
gentleman, and--he regarded John Steele expectantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[pg
291]</span>Steele spoke now; his dark eyes shone strangely; a sardonic
expression lurked there. The proprietor could bring his companion a steak,
if he had one. Large or small?--large--with an enigmatical smile.</p>

<p>The "hexibition styke" in the window; would that do, queried the
proprietor, displaying it.</p>

<p>Would it? the eyes of the erstwhile dandy of the east side asked of John
Steele; that gentleman only answered with a nod, and the supplemental
information that he would take "half a dozen natives himself." The
proprietor bustled out; from an opposite corner of the room, the only other
occupant regarded with casual curiosity the two ill-assorted figures. Tall,
florid, Amazonian, this third person represented a fair example of the
London grisette, the <i>petite dame</i> who is not very petite, of its
thoroughfares. Setting down a pewter pot fit for a guardsman, she rose and
sauntered toward the door; stopping there, with one hand on her hip, she
looked back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[pg
292]</span>"Ever see 'im?" she observed, nodding her bonnet at the
portrait. "Noticed you appeared hinterested, as if you 'ad!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" Steele laughed, not pleasantly. "In my mind's eye, as the
poet says."</p>

<p>"Wot the--!" she retorted elegantly. "'Ere's a swell toff to chawf a
lidy! 'Owever," reflectively, "I'ave 'eard 'e could 'it 'ard!"</p>

<p>"But that," said the gentleman, indicating the tankard, "could hit
harder."</p>

<p>"My hyes; wot's the name of yer missionary friend, ragbags?" to Joe.</p>

<p>"The gentleman's a lawyer, and when I tell you his name is--"</p>

<p>John Steele reached over and stopped the speaker; the woman laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it ayn't syfe to give it!"</p>

<p>Her voice floated back now from the threshold; predominated for a moment
later in one of the corners of the bar leading to the street: "Oi soi, you
cawn't go in for a 'arf of bitters without a bloomin' graveyard mist comin'
up be'ind yer back!" Then the door slammed; the modern prototype of the
"roaring girl" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293"
id="Page_293"></a>[pg 293]</span>vanished, and another voice--hoarse, that
of a man--was heard:</p>

<p>"The blarsted fog is coming down fast."</p>

<p>For some time the two men in the little back room sat silent; then one
of them leaned over: "She might have asked you that question, eh, Joe?" The
speaker's eyes had turned again to the picture.</p>

<p>The smaller man drew back; a shiver seemed to run over him. "They're a
long while about the steak," he murmured.</p>

<p>"For your testimony helped to send him over the water, I believe?" went
on the other.</p>

<p>"How do you--? I ain't on the stand now, Mr. Steele!" A spark of
defiance momentarily came into Dandy Joe's eyes.</p>

<p>"No; no!" John Steele leaned back, half closed his eyes; again pain,
fatigue seemed creeping over him. Outside sounded the clicking and clinking
of glasses, a staccato of guffaws, tones <i>vivace</i>. "The harm's been
done so far as you are concerned; you, as a factor, have disappeared from
the case."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear you say so, Mr. Steele. I <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[pg 294]</span>mean," the other's voice
was uncertain, cautious, "that's a matter long since dead and done with.
Didn't imagine you ever knew about it; because that was before your time;
you weren't even in London then." The keen eyes of the listener rested
steadily on the other; seemed to read deeper. "But as for my testimony
helping to send him over the water--"</p>

<p>"Or under!" <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>Joe swallowed. "It was true, every word of it."</p>

<p>"Good!" John Steele spoke almost listlessly. "Always stick by any one
who sticks to you,--whether a friend, or a pal, or a patron."</p>

<p>"A patron!" From the other's lips fell an oath; he seemed about to say
something but checked himself; the seconds went by.</p>

<p>"But even if there had been something not quite--strictly in
accord--which there wasn't"--quickly--"a man couldn't gainsay what had been
said," Dandy Joe began.</p>

<p>"He could," indifferently.</p>

<p>"But that would be--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[pg
295]</span>"Confessing to perjury? Yes."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Mr. Steele!" The man's eyes began to shine with alarm. "I'm
not on the---"</p>

<p>"I know. And it wouldn't do any good, if you were."</p>

<p>"You mean--" in spite of himself, the fellow's tones wavered--"because
he's under the water?"</p>

<p>"No; I had in mind that even if he hadn't been drowned, your---"</p>

<p>"Wot! Hadn't---"</p>

<p>"A purely hypothetical case! If the sea gave up its dead"--Joe stirred
uneasily--"any retraction on your part wouldn't serve him. In the first
place, you wouldn't confess; then if you did--which you wouldn't--to employ
the sort of Irish bull you yourself used--you would be discredited. And
thus, in any contingency," leaning back with folded arms, his head against
the wall, "you have become <i>nil</i>!"</p>

<p>"Blest if I follow you, sir!"</p>

<p>"That, also," said John Steele, "doesn't matter. The principal subject
of any consequence, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296"
id="Page_296"></a>[pg 296]</span>relating to you, is the steak, which is
now coming." As he spoke, he rose, leaving Dandy Joe alone at the
table.</p>

<p>For a time he did not speak; sitting before a cheerless fire, that
feebly attempted to assert itself, he looked once or twice toward the door,
as if mindful to go out and leave the place.</p>

<p>But for an inexplicable reason he did not do so; there was nothing to be
gained here; yet he lingered. Perhaps one of those subtle, illusory
influences we do not yet understand, and which sometimes shape the
blundering finite will, mysteriously, without conscious volition, was at
work. One about to stumble blindly forward, occasionally stops; why, he
knows not.</p>

<p>John Steele continued to regard the dark coals; to divers and sundry
sounds from the table where the other ate, he seemed oblivious. Once when
the proprietor stepped in, he asked, without looking around, for a certain
number of grains of quinine with a glass of water; they probably kept it at
the bar. Yes, the man always had it on hand and brought it in.</p>

<p>A touch of fever, might he ask, as the visitor <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[pg 297]</span>took it; nothing to speak
of, was the indifferent answer.</p>

<p>Well, the gentleman should have a care; the gentleman did not reply
except to ask for the reckoning; the proprietor figured a moment, then
departed with the sovereign that had been tossed to the table.</p>

<p>By this time Dandy Joe had pushed back his chair; his dull eyes gleamed
with satisfaction; also, perhaps, with a little calculation.</p>

<p>"Thanking you kindly, sir, it's more than I had a right to expect. If
ever I can do anything to show--"</p>

<p>"You can't!"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose so," humbly. Joe looked down; he was thinking; a
certain matter in which self-interest played no small part had come to
mind. John Steele was known to be generous in his services and small in his
charges. Joe regarded him covertly. "Asking your pardon for referring to
it--but you've helped so many a poor chap--there's an old pal of mine what
is down on his luck, and, happenin' across him the other day, he was asking
of me for a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[pg
298]</span>good lawyer, who could give him straight talk. One moment, sir!
He can pay, or soon would be able to, if--"</p>

<p>"I am not at present," Steele experienced a sense of grim humor,
"looking for new clients."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I'd be mentioning the matter, sir, although I hadn't
much hopes of him being able to interest the likes of you. You see he's
been out of old England for a long time, and was goin' away again, when
w'at should he suddenly hear but that his old woman that was, meaning his
mother, died and left a tidy bit. A few hundred pounds or so; enough to
start a nice, little pub. for him and me to run; only it's in the hands of
a trustee, who is waiting for him to appear and claim it."</p>

<p>"You say he has been out of England?" John Steele stopped. "How
long?"</p>

<p>"A good many years. There was one or two little matters agin him when he
left 'ome; but he has heard that certain offenses may be 'outlawed.' Not
that he has much 'ope his'n had, only he wanted to see a lawyer; and find
out, in any case, how he could get his money without--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[pg
299]</span>"The law getting hold of him? What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Tom Rogers."</p>

<p>For some minutes John Steele did not speak; he stood motionless. On the
street before the house a barrel-organ began to play; its tones, broken,
wheezy, appealed, nevertheless, to the sodden senses of those at the
bar:</p>

<blockquote>
"Down with the Liberals, Tories,<br />
Parties of all degree."<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Dandy Joe smiled, beat time with his hand.</p>

<p>"You can give me," John Steele spoke bruskly, taking from his pocket a
note-book, "this Tom Rogers' address."</p>

<p>Joe looked at the other, seemed about to speak on the impulse, but did
not; then his hand slowly ceased its motion.</p>

<p>"I, sir--you see, I can't quite do that--for Tom's laying low, you
understand. But if you would let him call around quiet-like, on you--"</p>

<p>John Steele replaced the note-book. "On me?" He spoke slowly; Dandy Joe
regarded <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[pg
300]</span>him with small crafty eyes. "I hardly think the case will prove
sufficiently attractive."</p>

<p>The other made no answer; looked away thoughtfully; at the same moment
the proprietor stepped in. Steele took the change that was laid on the
table, leaving a half-crown, which he indicated that Dandy Joe could
appropriate.</p>

<p>"Better not think of going now, sir," the proprietor said to John
Steele. "Never saw anything like it the way the fog has thickened; a man
couldn't get across London to-night to save his neck."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he?" Dandy Joe stepped toward the door. "I'm going to have a
try."</p>

<p>A mist blew in; Dandy Joe went out. John Steele waited a moment, then
with a perfunctory nod, walked quietly to the front door. The man had not
exaggerated the situation; the fog lay before him like a thick yellow
blanket. He looked in the direction his late companion had turned; his
figure was just discernible; in a moment it would have been swallowed by
the fog, when quickly John Steele walked after him.</p>

<h3><a name='THROUGH_THE_FOG'></a>THROUGH THE FOG</h3>


<p>The dense veil overhanging the city, while favorable to John Steele in
some respects, lessening for the time his own danger, made more difficult
the task to which he now set himself. He dared not too closely approach the
figure before him, lest he should be seen and his purpose divined; once or
twice Dandy Joe looked around, more, perhaps, from habit than any suspicion
that he was followed. Then the other, slackening his steps, sometimes held
back too far and through caution imperiled his plan by nearly losing sight
of Dandy Joe altogether. As they went on with varying pace, the shuffling
form ahead seemed to find the way by instinct; crossed unhesitatingly many
intersecting thoroughfares; paused only on the verge of a great one.</p>

<p>Here, where opposing currents had met and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[pg 302]</span>become congested, utter
confusion reigned; from the masses of vehicles of all kinds, constituting a
seemingly inextricable blockade, arose the din of hoarse voices. With the
fellow's figure a vague swaying shadow before him, John Steele, too,
stopped; stared at the dim blotches of light; listened to the anathemas,
the angry snapping of whips. Would Dandy Joe plunge into the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e; attempt to pass through that tangle of horses and men?
Apparently he found discretion the better part of valor and moving back so
quickly he almost touched John Steele, he walked down the intersecting
avenue.</p>

<p>Several blocks farther on, the turmoil seemed less marked, and here he
essayed to cross; by dint of dodging and darting between restless horses he
reached the other side. A sudden closing in of cabs and carts midway
between curbs held John Steele back; he caught quickly at the bridle of the
nearest horse and forced it aside. An expostulating shout, a half-scream
from somewhere greeted the action; a whip snapped, stung his cheek. An
instant he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[pg
303]</span>paused as if to leap up and drag the aggressor from his seat,
but instead with closed hands and set face he pushed on; to be blocked
again by an importunate cab.</p>

<p>"Turn back; get out of this somehow, cabby!" He heard familiar tones,
saw the speaker, Sir Charles, and, by his side--yes, through the curtain of
fog, so near he could almost reach out and touch her, he saw as in a flash,
Jocelyn Wray!</p>

<p>She, too, saw him, the man in the street, his pale face lifted up,
ghost-like, from the mist. A cry fell from her lips, was lost amid other
sounds. An instant eyes looked into eyes; hers, dilated; his, unnaturally
bright, burning! Then as in a daze the beautiful head bent toward him; the
daintily clad figure leaned forward, the sensitive and trembling lips half
parted.</p>

<p>John Steele sprang back, to get free, to get out of there at once! Did
she call? he did not know; it might be she had given voice to her surprise,
but now only the clatter and uproar could be heard. In the fog, however,
her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[pg
304]</span>face seemed still to follow; confused, for a moment, he did not
heed his way. Something struck him--a wheel? He half fell, recovered
himself, managed to reach the curb.</p>

<p>He was conscious now of louder shoutings; of the sting on his cheek; of
the traffic, drifting on--slowly. Then he, too, started to walk away, in
the opposite direction; it mattered little whither he bent his footsteps
now. Dandy Joe had disappeared; the hope of attaining his end through him,
of being led to the retreat of one he had so long desired to find, had
proved illusive. The last moment's halt had enabled him to escape, to fade
from view like a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>John Steele did not go far in mere aimless fashion; leaning against a
wall he strove once more to plan, but ever as he did so, through his
thought the girl's fair face, looking out from enshrouding lace, intruded.
Again he felt the light of her eyes, all the bitterness of spirit their
surprise, consternation, had once more awakened in him.</p>

<p>He looked out at the wagons, the carts, the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[pg 305]</span>nondescript vehicles of
every description; but a moment before she had been there,--so near; he had
caught beneath filmy white the glitter of gold,--her hair, the only bright
thing in that murk and gloom. He recalled how he had once sat beside her at
the opera. How different was this babel, this grinding and crunching of
London's thundering wheels!</p>

<p>But around her had always been dreams that had led him into strange
byways, through dangerous, though flowery paths! To what end? To see her
start, her eyes wide with involuntary dread, shrinking? Could he not thus
interpret that look he had seen by the flare of a carriage lamp, when she
had caught sight of him?</p>

<p>Dread of him? It seemed the crowning mockery; his blood surged faster;
he forgot his purpose, when a figure coming out of a public house, through
one of the doors near which he had halted, caught his attention. Dandy Joe,
a prodigal with unexpected riches, wiped his lips as he sauntered past John
Steele and continued his way, lurching a little.</p>

<p>How long did Steele walk after him? The <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[pg 306]</span>distance across the city
was far; groping, occasionally stumbling, it seemed interminable now. Once
or twice Dandy Joe lost his way, and jocularly accosted passers-by to
inquire. At Seven Dials he experienced difficulty in determining which one
of the miserable streets radiating as from a common hub, would lead him in
the desired direction; but, after looking hastily at various objects--a
barber's post, a metal plate on a wall--he selected his street. Narrow,
dark, it wormed its way through a cankered and little-traversed part of old
London.</p>

<p>For a time they two seemed the only pedestrians that had ventured forth
that night in a locality so uninviting. On either side the houses pressed
closer upon them. Touching a wall here and there, John Steele experienced
the vague sensation that he had walked that way on other occasions, long,
long ago. Or was it only a bad dream that again stirred him? Through the
gulch-like passage swept a cold draft of air; it made little rifts in the
fog; showed an entrance, a dim light. At the same <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[pg 307]</span>time the sound of the
footsteps in front abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Steele waited; he looked toward the place Dandy Joe
had entered. It was well-known to him, and, what seemed more important, to
Mr. Gillett; the latter would remember it in connection with the 'Frisco
Pet; presumably turn to it as a likely spot to search for him who had been
forced to leave Captain Forsythe's home. That contingency--nay,
probability--had to be considered; the one person he most needed to find
had taken refuge in one of the places he would have preferred not to enter.
But no time must be lost hesitating; he had to choose. Dismissing all
thought of danger from without, thinking only of what lay before him
within, he moved quickly forward and tried the door.</p>

<p>It yielded; had Dandy Joe left it unfastened purposely to lure him
within, or had his potations made him unmindful? The man outside neither
knew nor cared; the mocking consciousness that he had turned that knob
before, knew how to proceed, held him. He entered, felt his <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[pg 308]</span>way in
the darkness through winding passages, downward, avoiding a bad step--did
he remember even that?</p>

<p>How paltry details stood out! The earthen floor still drowned the sound
of footsteps; the narrow hall took the same turns; led on and on in devious
fashion until he could hear, like the faint hum of bees, the distant rumble
from the great thoroughfares, somewhere above, that paralleled the course
of the river. At the same time a slant of light like a sword, from the
crack of a door, gleamed on the dark floor before him; he stepped toward
it; the low sound of men's tones could be heard--Joe's; a strange voice!
no, a familiar one!--that caused the listener's every fiber to vibrate.</p>

<p>"And what did you say, when he pumped you for the cote?"</p>

<p>"That you would rather call on him."</p>

<p>"And then he cared nought for the job? You're sure"--anxiously--"he
wasn't playing to find out?"</p>

<p>The other answered jocosely and walked away; a door closed behind him.
For a time <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[pg
309]</span>the stillness remained unbroken; then a low rattle, as of dice
on a table, caused John Steele to glance through a crevice. What he saw
seemed to decide him to act quickly; he lifted a latch and stepped in. As
he did so a huge man with red hair sprang to his feet; from one great hand
the dice fell to the floor; his shaggy jowl drooped. Casting over his
shoulder the swift glance of an entrapped animal, he seemed about to leap
backward to escape by a rear entrance when the voice of the intruder
arrested his purpose, momentarily held him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm alone! There are no police outside." He spoke in the dialect of
the pick-purse and magsman. To prove it, John Steele stooped and locked the
door.</p>

<p>The small bloodshot eyes lighted with wonder; the heavy brutish jaws
began to harden. "Alone?"</p>

<p>The other tossed the key; it fell at the man's feet; John Steele walked
over to the opposite door and shot a heavy bolt there. "Looks as if it
would hold," he said in thieves' argot as he turned around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[pg
310]</span>"Are ye a gaby?" The red-headed giant stared ominously at
him.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," coolly, "I know very well what I am doing."</p>

<p>A question interlarded with oaths burst from the other's throat; John
Steele regarded the man quietly. "I should think it apparent what I want!"
he answered. As he spoke, he sat down. "It is you," bending his bright,
resolute eyes on the other.</p>

<p>"And you've come alone?" He drew up his ponderous form.</p>

<p>John Steele smiled. "I assure you I welcomed the opportunity."</p>

<p>"You won't long." The great fists closed. "Do you know what I am going
to do to you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any curiosity," still clinging to thieves' jargon or St.
Giles Greek. "But I'm sure you won't play me the trick you did the last
time I saw you."</p>

<p>The fellow shot his head near; in his look shone a gleam of recognition.
"You're the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[pg
311]</span>swell cove who wanted to palaver that night when--"</p>

<p>"You tried to rob me of my purse?"</p>

<p>John Steele laughed; his glance lingered on his bulky adversary with
odd, persistent exhilaration, as if after all that had gone before, this
contest royal, which promised to become one of sheer brute strength, awoke
to its utmost a primal fighting force in him. "Do you know the penalty for
attempting that game, Tom Rogers, alias Tom-o'-the-Road; alias---"</p>

<p>The man fell back, in his eyes a look of ferocious wonderment. "Who are
you? By---!" he said.</p>

<p>"John Steele."</p>

<p>"John Steele?" The bloodshot eyes became slightly vacuous. "The--? Then
you used him," indicating savagely the entrance at the back, "for a duck to
uncover?" Steele nodded. "And you're the one who's been so long at my
heels?" Rage caused the hot blood to suffuse the man's face. "I'll burke
you for that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[pg
312]</span>John Steele did not stir; for an instant his look, confident,
assured, seemed to keep the other back. "How? With the lead, or--"</p>

<p>The fellow lifted his hairy fists. "Those are all I--"</p>

<p>"In that case--" Steele took the weapon, on which his hand had rested,
from his pocket; rising with alacrity he placed it on a rickety stand
behind him. "You have me a little outclassed; about seventeen stone, I
should take it; barely turn thirteen, myself. However," tossing his coat in
the corner, "you look a little soft; hardly up to what you were when you
got the belt for the heavy-weight championship. Do you remember? The
'Frisco Pet went against you; but he was only a low, ignorant sailor and
had let himself get out of form. You beat him, beat him," John Steele's
eyes glittered; he touched the other on the arm, "though he fought
seventeen good rounds! You stamped the heart out of him, Tom."</p>

<p>The red-headed giant's arms fell to his side. "How do you--"</p>

<p>"I was there!" An odd smile crossed <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[pg 313]</span>Steele's determined lips.
"Lost a little money on that battle. Recall the fourteenth round? He nearly
had you; but you played safe in the fifteenth, and then--you sent him
down--down," John Steele's voice died away. "It was a long time before he
got up," he added, almost absently.</p>

<p>The listener's face had become a study; perplexity mingled with other
conflicting emotions. "You know all that--?"</p>

<p>"And all the rest! How for you the fascination of the road became
greater than that of the ring; how the old wildness would crop out; how the
highway drew you, until--"</p>

<p>"See here, what's your little game? Straight now; quick! You come here,
without the police, why?"</p>

<p>John Steele's reply was to the point; he stated exactly what he wanted
and what he meant that the other should give him. As the fellow heard, he
breathed harder; he held himself in with difficulty.</p>

<p>"And so that's what you've come for, Mister?" he said, a hoarse guffaw
falling from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314"
id="Page_314"></a>[pg 314]</span>coarse lips. John Steele answered quietly.
"And you think there is any chance of your getting it? May I be asking,"
with an evil grin, "how you expect to make me, Tom Rogers," bringing down
his great fist, "do your bidding?"</p>

<p>"In the first place by assuring you no harm shall come to you. It is in
my power to avert that, in case you comply. In the second place, you will
be given enough sovereigns to--"</p>

<p>"Quids, eh? Let me have sight of them, Mister. We might talk
better."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd bring them here, Tom-o'-the-Road? No, no!"
bruskly.</p>

<p>"That settles it." The other made a gesture, contemptuous,
dissenting.</p>

<p>John Steele's manner changed; he turned suddenly on the fellow like
lightning. "In the next place by giving you your choice of doing what I
ask, or of being turned over to the traps."</p>

<p>"The traps!" The other fellow's face became contorted. "You mean that
you--"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[pg
315]</span>"Will give you up for that little job, unless--"</p>

<p>For answer the man launched his huge body forward, with fierce swinging
fists.</p>

<p>What happened thereafter was at once brutish, terrible, Homeric; the
fellow's reserves of strength seemed immense; sheer animal rage drove him;
he ran amuck with lust to kill. He beat, rushed, strove to close. His
opponent's lithe body evaded a clutch that might have ended the contest.
John Steele fought without sign of anger, like a machine, wonderfully
trained; missing no point, regardless of punishment. He knew that if he
went down once, all rules of battle would be discarded; a powerful blow
sent him staggering to the wall; he leaned against it an instant; waited,
with the strong, impelling look people had noticed on his face when he was
fighting in a different way, in the courts.</p>

<p>The other came at him, muttering; the mill had unduly prolonged itself;
he would end it. His fist struck at that face so elusive; but <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[pg 316]</span>crashed
against the wall; like a flash Steele's arm lifted. The great form
staggered, fell.</p>

<p>Quickly, however, it rose and the battle was resumed. Now, despite John
Steele's vigilance, the two came together. Tom Rogers' arm wound round him
with suffocating power; strove, strained, to hurl him to earth. But the
other's perfect training, his orderly living, saved him at that crucial
moment; his strength of endurance lasted; with a great effort he managed to
tear himself loose and at the same time with a powerful upper stroke to
send Rogers once more to the floor. Again, however, he got to his feet;
John Steele's every muscle ached; his shoulder was bleeding anew. The need
for acting quickly, if he should hope to conquer, pressed on him;
fortunately Rogers in his blind rage was fighting wildly. John Steele
endured blow after blow; then, as through a mist, he found at length the
opening he sought; an instant's opportunity on which all depended.</p>

<p>Every fiber of his physical being responded; he threw himself forward,
the weight of his body, the force of a culminating impetus, went <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[pg 317]</span>into
his fist; it hit heavily; full on the point of the chin beneath the brutal
mouth. Tom Rogers' head shot back as if he had received the blow of a
hammer; he threw up his arms; this time he lay where he struck the
ground.</p>

<p>John Steele swayed; with an effort he sustained himself. Was it over?
Still Rogers did not move; Steele stooped, felt his heart; it beat slowly.
Mechanically, as if hardly knowing what he did, John Steele began to count;
"Time!" Rogers continued to lie like a log; his mouth gaped; the blow, in
the parlance of the ring, had been a "knock-out"; or, in this case, a
<i>quid pro quo</i>. Yes, the last, but without referee or spectators! The
prostrate man did stir now; he groaned; John Steele touched him with his
foot.</p>

<p>"Get up," he said.</p>

<p>The other half-raised himself and regarded the speaker with dazed eyes.
"What for?"</p>

<p>John Steele went to the stand, picked up his revolver, and then sat down
at a table. "You're as foul a fighter as you ever were," he said
contemptuously.</p>

<h3><a name='THE_LAST_SHIFT'></a>THE LAST SHIFT</h3>


<p>The candle burned low; it threw now on grimy floor and wall the shadows
of the two men, one seated at the table, the other not far from it. Before
John Steele lay paper and ink, procured from some niche. He had ceased
writing; for the moment he leaned back, his vigilant gaze on the figure
near-by. From a corner of the room the rasping sound of a rat, gnawing,
broke the stillness, then suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>"Where were you on the night this woman, Amy Gerard, was found
dead?"</p>

<p>A momentary expression of surprise, of alarm, crossed the bruised and
battered face; it was succeeded by an angry suspicion that glowed from the
evil eyes. "You're not trying to fix that job on---"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[pg
319]</span>"You? No."</p>

<p>"Then what did you follow him here for, to pump me? The Yankee that got
transported is--"</p>

<p>"As alive as when he stepped before you in the ring!"</p>

<p>"Alive?" The fellow stared. "Not in England? It was death for him to
come back!"</p>

<p>"Never mind his whereabouts."</p>

<p>The man looked at Steele closer. "Blame, if there isn't something about
you that puzzles me," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" laconically.</p>

<p>The fellow shook his head. "And so he's hired you?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Although I may say I represent him."</p>

<p>"Well, he got a good one. You know how to use your fists, Mister."</p>

<p>"Better than this 'Frisco Pet did once, eh, Tom?" The man frowned. "But
to return to the subject in hand. That question you <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[pg 320]</span>seemed
afraid to answer just now was superfluous; I know where you were the night
the woman was shot."</p>

<p>"You do?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you were--" John Steele leaned forward and said something
softly.</p>

<p>"How'd you find that out?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"The 'Frisco Pet knew where you were all the time; but did not speak,
because he did not wish to get you into trouble. Also, because he did not
know, then, what he long afterward learned,--indirectly!--that you could
have cleared him!"</p>

<p>"Indirectly? I? What do you--?"</p>

<p>"Through your once having dropped a few words. Wine in, wits out!"</p>

<p>The fellow scowled; edged his chair closer.</p>

<p>"Keep where you are!" John Steele's hand touched the revolver now on the
table before him; even as it did so, the room seemed to sway, and it was
only by a strong effort of will he kept his attention on the matter in
hand, fought down the dizziness. "And let's get through <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[pg 321]</span>with
this! I don't care to waste much more of my time on you."</p>

<p>"You're sure nothing will happen to me, if--" The man watched him
closer.</p>

<p>"This paper need never be made public."</p>

<p>"Then what--"</p>

<p>"That's my business. It might be useful in certain contingencies."</p>

<p>"Such as the police discovering he hadn't gone to Davy Jones' locker?"
shrewdly.</p>

<p>John Steele's answer was short, as if he found this verbal contest
trite, paltry, after the physical struggle that had preceded it.</p>

<p>"And what am I to get if I do what you--" The pupils of the fellow's
eyes, fastened on him, were now like pin-points.</p>

<p>The other smiled grimly; this bargaining and trafficking with such a
man, in a place so foul! It seemed grotesque, incongruous; and yet was,
withal, so momentous. He knew just what Rogers should say; what he would
force him to do! In his overwrought state he overlooked one or two points
that would not have escaped <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322"
id="Page_322"></a>[pg 322]</span>him at another time: a certain craftiness,
or low cunning that played occasionally on that disfigured face.</p>

<p>"What did you say I was to get if--"</p>

<p>"You shall have funds to take you out of the country, and I will engage
to get and forward to you the money left in trust. The alternative," he
bent forward, "about fifteen years, if the traps--"</p>

<p>The fellow pondered; at last he answered. For a few minutes then John
Steele wrote, looking up between words. His head bent now closer to the
paper, then drew back from it, as if through a slight uncertainty of vision
or because of the dim light. The fellow's eyes, watching him, lowered.</p>

<p>"You know--none better!--that on that particular night some one
else--some one besides the 'Frisco Pet--entered your mother's house?"</p>

<p>Oaths mingled with low filchers' slang; but the reply was forthcoming;
other questions, too, were answered tentatively; sometimes at length, with
repulsive fullness of detail. The speaker <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[pg 323]</span>hesitated over words, shot
sharp, short looks at the other; from the hand that wrote, to the fingers
near that other object,--strong, firm fingers that seemed ready to leap;
ready to act on any emergency. Unless--a shadow appeared to pass over the
broad, white brow, the motionless hand to waver, ever so little. Then
quickly the hand moved, rested on the brown handle of the weapon, enveloped
it with light careless grasp.</p>

<p>"You can state of your own knowledge what happened next?" John Steele
spoke sharply; the fellow's red brows suddenly lifted.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied readily.</p>

<p>John Steele's manner became shorter; his questions were put fast; he
forced quick replies. He not only seemed striving to get through his task
as soon as possible; but always to hold the other's attention, to permit
his brain no chance to wander from the subject to any other. But the fellow
seemed now to have become as tractable as before he had been sullen,
stubborn; gave his version in his own vernacular, always keenly attentive,
observant of the other's every <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324"
id="Page_324"></a>[pg 324]</span>motion. His strength had apparently
returned; he seemed little the worse for his late encounter. At length came
an interval; just for an instant John Steele's eyes shut; the fingers that
had held the pen closed on the edge of the table. A quick passing
expression of ferocity hovered at the corners of the observer's thick lips;
he got up; at the same time John Steele rose and stepped abruptly back.</p>

<p>"You know how to write your name?" His voice was firm, unwavering; the
revolver had disappeared from the table and lay now in his pocket.</p>

<p>"All right, gov'ner!" The other spoke with alacrity. "I'm game; a
bargain is a bargain, and I'll take your word for it," leaning over and
laboriously tracing a few letters on the paper. "You'll do your part.
You'll find me square and above board, although you did use me a little
rough. There, here's your affadavy."</p>

<p>John Steele moved back to a corner of the room and pulled a wire; in
some far-away place a bell rang faintly. "Are----," he spoke a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[pg 325]</span>woman's
name, obviously a sobriquet, "and her daughter still here?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Never mind; answer."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're here, gov'ner. You'll want them for witnesses, I suppose.
Well, I'll not be gainsaying you." His tones were loud; conveyed a sense of
rough heartiness; the other made no reply.</p>

<p>Not long after, the paper, duly witnessed, lay on the table; the
landlady and her daughter had gone; John Steele only waited for the ink to
dry. He had no blotter, or sand; the fluid was old, thick; the principal
signature in its big strokes, with here and there a splutter, would be
unintelligible if the paper were folded now. So he lingered; both men were
silent; a few tense minutes passed. John Steele leaned against the wall;
his temples throbbed; the fog seemed creeping into the room and yet the
door was closed. He moved toward the paper; still maintaining an aspect of
outward vigilance, took it and held it before him as if to examine
closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[pg
326]</span>The other said nothing, made no movement. When the women had
come in, his accents had been almost too frank; the gentleman had called on
a little matter of business; he, Tom Rogers, had voluntarily signed this
little paper, and they could bear witness to the fact. Now all that
profanely free air had left him; he stood like a statue, his lips
compressed; his eyes alone were alive, speaking, alert.</p>

<p>John Steele folded the paper and placed it in an inside pocket. The
other suddenly breathed heavily; John Steele, looking at him, walked to the
door leading to the street. He put his hand on the key and was about to
turn it, but paused. Something without held his attention,--a crunching
sound as of a foot on a pebble. It abruptly revived misgivings that had
assailed him before entering the place, that he had felt as a vague weight
while dealing with the fellow. The police agent! Time had passed, too great
an interval, though he had hastened, hastened as best he might, struggling
with his own growing weakness, the other's reviving power.</p>

<p>Again the sound! Involuntarily he turned <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[pg 327]</span>his head; it was only an
instant's inattention, but Tom Rogers had been waiting for it. Springing
behind in a flash, he seized John Steele by the throat. It was a deadly,
terrible grip; the fingers pressed harder; the other strove, but slowly
fell. As dizziness began to merge into oblivion, Rogers, without releasing
his hold, bent over.</p>

<p>"You fool! Did you think I would let you get away with the paper? That I
couldn't see you were about done for?"</p>

<p>He looked at the white face; started to unbutton the coat; as he reached
in, his attention was suddenly arrested; he threw back his head.</p>

<p>"The traps!"</p>

<p>Voices below resounded without.</p>

<p>"So that was your game! Well," savagely, "I think I have settled with
you."</p>

<p>He had but time to run to the rear door, unbolt it and dash out, when a
crashing of woodwork filled the place, and Mr. Gillett looked in.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[pg

<h3><a name='THE_PAPER'></a>THE PAPER</h3>


<p>When John Steele began to recover, he was dimly aware that he was in a
four-wheeler which rattled along slowly through streets, now slightly more
discernible; by his side sat a figure that stirred when he did; spoke in
crisp, official accents. He, Mr. Steele, would kindly not place any further
obstacles in the way of justice being done; it was useless to attempt that;
the police agent had come well armed, and, moreover, had taken the
precaution for this little journey of providing a cab in front and one
behind, containing those who knew how to act should the necessity
arise.</p>

<p>John Steele heard these words without answering; his throat pained him;
he could scarcely swallow; his head seemed bound around as by a tight,
inflexible band. The cool air, however, gradually revived him; he drank it
in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[pg
329]</span>gratefully and strove to think. A realization of what had
occurred surged through his brain,--the abrupt attack at the door; the
arrival of the police agent.</p>

<p>Furtively the prisoner felt his pocket; the memorandum book containing
the paper that had cost so much was gone; he looked at the agent. Had it
been shifted to Mr. Gillett's possession, or, dimly he recalled his
assailant's last words, had Rogers succeeded in snatching the precious
evidence from his breast before escaping? In the latter case, it had,
undoubtedly, ere this, been destroyed; in the former, it would, presumably,
soon be transferred to the police agent's employer. To regain the paper, if
it existed, would be no light task; yet it was the pivot upon which John
Steele's fortunes hung. The principal signer was, in all likelihood, making
his way out of London now; he would, in a few hours, reach the sea, and
after that disappear from the case. At any rate, John Steele could have
nothing to hope from him in the future; the opportune or inopportune
appearance of the police agent would savor of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[pg 330]</span>treachery to him. John
Steele moved, quickly, impatiently; but a hand, swung carelessly behind
him, moved also,--a hand that held something hard.</p>

<p>Thereafter he remained outwardly quiescent; resistance on his part, and
the consequences that would ensue, might not be displeasing to his chief
enemy; it would settle the case in short and summary fashion. Justification
for extreme proceedings would be easily forthcoming and there would be none
to answer for John Steele.</p>

<p>Where were they going? John Steele could not surmise; he saw, however
that they had left behind the neighborhood of hovels, narrow passages and
byways, and traversed now one of the principal circuses. There the street
traffic moved smoothly; they seemed but an unimportant part of an endless
procession which they soon left to turn into a less public, more
aristocratic highway. A short distance down this street, the carriages
suddenly stopped before an eminently respectable and sedate <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[pg 331]</span>front,
and, not long after, John Steele, somewhat to his surprise, found himself
in Lord Ronsdale's rooms and that person's presence.</p>

<p>The nobleman had been forewarned of John Steele's coming. He sat behind
a high desk, his figure and part of his face screened by its massive back.
One drawer of the desk was slightly opened. What could be seen of his
features appeared sharper than usual, as if the inner virulence, the dark
hidden passions smoldering in his breast had at length stamped their
impression on the outer man. When he first spoke his tones were more
irascible, less icily imperturbable, than they had been hitherto. They
seemed to tell of a secret tension he had long been laboring under; but the
steady cold eyes looked out from behind the wood barrier with vicious
assurance.</p>

<p>The police agent he addressed first; his services could be dispensed
with for the present; he should, however, remain in the hall with his men.
Mr. Gillett looked from the speaker to him he had brought there and after a
moment turned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332"
id="Page_332"></a>[pg 332]</span>and obeyed; but the instant's hesitation
seemed to say that he began to realize there was more to the affair than he
had fathomed.</p>

<p>"There is no need for many words between us, Mr. Steele." Lord
Ronsdale's accents were poignant and sharp. "Had you listened to what Mr.
Gillett, on my behalf, would have said to you that night in the gardens at
Strathorn House, we might, possibly, both of us, have been saved some
little annoyance. We now start at about where we were before that little
contretemps."</p>

<p>John Steele silently looked at Lord Ronsdale; his brain had again become
clear; his thoughts, lucid. The ride through the cool and damp air, this
outr&eacute; encounter at the end of the journey, had acted as a tonic on
jaded sense and faculty. He saw distinctly, heard very plainly; his ideas
began to marshal themselves logically. He could have laughed at Lord
Ronsdale, but the situation was too serious; the weakness of his defenses
too obvious. Proofs, proofs, proofs, were what the English jury demanded,
and where were his? He could build up a story; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[pg 333]</span>yes, but--if he could have
known what had taken place between Mr. Gillett and this man a few minutes
before, when the police agent had stepped in first and tarried here a brief
period before ushering him in!</p>

<p>Had Mr. Gillett delivered to his noble patron the memorandum book and
other articles filched from John Steele's pockets? That partly opened
drawer--what did it contain? The nobleman's hand lingered on the edge of
it; with an effort the other resisted allowing his glance to rest
there.</p>

<p>He even refused to smile when Lord Ronsdale, after a sharper look, asked
him to be seated; he seemed to sift and weigh the pros and cons of the
invitation in a curious, calm fashion; as if he felt himself there in some
impersonal capacity for the purpose of solving a difficult catechetical
problem.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think I will." He sat down in a stiff, straight-backed chair; it
may be he felt the need of holding in reserve all his physical force, of
not refusing to rest, even here.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale's glance narrowed; he hesitated <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[pg 334]</span>an instant. "To go back to
Strathorn House--a very beautiful place to go back to," his tones for the
moment lapsed to that high pitch they sometimes assumed, "Mr Gillett had
there received from me certain instructions. Whatever you once were,"
seeming not to notice the other's expression, "you have since by your own
efforts attained much. How--?" His brows knit as at something inexplicable.
"But the fact remained, was perhaps considered. Exposure would have meant
some--unpleasantness for your friends." The eyes of the two men met; those
of Lord Ronsdale were full of sardonic meaning. "Friends who had trusted
you; who," softly, "had admitted you to their firesides, not knowing--" he
broke off. "They," he still adhered to the plural, "would have been deeply
shocked, pained; would still be if they should learn--"</p>

<p>"If?" John Steele did manage to contain himself, but it was with an
effort; perhaps he saw again through the fog a girl's face, white and
accusing, which had appeared; vanished. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[pg 335]</span>"You spoke of certain
instructions?" he even forced himself to say.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gillett, in the garden at Strathorn House, was authorized by me to
offer you one chance of avoiding exposure, and," deliberately, "the
attendant consequences; you were to be suffered to leave London, this
country, with the stipulation that you should never return." John Steele
shifted slightly. "You did not expect this," quickly, "you had not included
that contingency in your calculations?"</p>

<p>"I confess," in an even, emotionless voice, "your lordship's
complaisance amazes me."</p>

<p>"And you would have accepted the alternative?" The nobleman's accents
were now those of the service, diplomatic; they were concise but
measured.</p>

<p>"Why discuss what could never have been considered?" was the brusk
answer.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale frowned. "We are still fencing; we will waste no more
time." Perhaps the other's manner, assured, contemptuously distant, goaded
him; perhaps he experienced <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336"
id="Page_336"></a>[pg 336]</span>anew all that first violent, unreasoning
anger against this man whose unexpected coming to London had plunged him
into an unwelcome and irritating role. "That alternative is still open.
Refuse, and--you will be in the hands of the authorities to-night.
Resist--" His glittering eyes left no doubt whatever as to his meaning.</p>

<p>"I shall not resist," said John Steele. "But--I refuse." He spoke
recklessly, regardlessly.</p>

<p>"In that case--" Lord Ronsdale half rose; his face looked drawn but
determined; he reached as if to touch a bell. "You force the issue,
and--"</p>

<p>"One moment." As he spoke John Steele stepped toward the fireplace; he
gazed downward at a tiny white ash on the glowing coals; a little film that
might have been--paper? "In a matter so important we may consider a little
longer, lest," still regarding the hearth, "there may be after-regrets."
His words even to himself sounded puerile; but what they led to had more
poignancy; he lifted now his keen <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337"
id="Page_337"></a>[pg 337]</span>glowing eyes. "In one little regard I did
your lordship an injustice."</p>

<p>"In what way?" The nobleman had been studying him closely, had followed
the direction of his glance; noted almost questioningly what it had rested
on--the coals, or vacancy?</p>

<p>"In supposing that you yourself murdered Amy Gerard," came the
unexpected response. The other started violently. "Your lordship will
forgive the assumption in view of what occurred on a certain stormy night
at sea, when a drowning wretch clung with one hand to a gunwale, and you,
in answer to his appeal for succor, bent over and--"</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" The words fell in a sharp whisper.</p>

<p>"What?" John Steele's laugh sounded mirthlessly. "However, we will give
a charitable interpretation to the act; the boat was already overcrowded;
one more might have endangered all. Call it an impulse of
self-preservation. Self-preservation," he repeated; "the struggle of the
survival of the fittest! Let the episode go. Especially as your lordship
incidentally <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[pg
338]</span>did me a great service; a very great service." The other stared
at him. "I should have looked at it only in that light, and then it would
not have played me the trick it did of affording a false hypothesis for a
certain conclusion. Your lordship knows what I mean, how the true facts in
this case of Amy Gerard have come to light?"</p>

<p>John Steele's glance was straight, direct; if the other had the paper,
had read it, he would know.</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale looked toward the bell, hesitated. "I think you had better
tell me," he said at last.</p>

<p>"If your lordship did not kill the woman--if the 'Frisco Pet did not,
then who did?" Ronsdale leaned forward just in the least; his eyes seemed
to look into the other's as if to ask how much, just what, he had learned.
John Steele studied the nobleman with a purpose of his own. "Why, she
killed herself," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"How?" The nobleman uttered this word, then stopped; John Steele waited.
Had Lord <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[pg
339]</span>Ronsdale been surprised at his knowledge? He could hardly tell,
from his manner, whether or not he had the affidavit and had read it.</p>

<p>"How--interesting!" The nobleman was willing to continue the verbal
contest a little longer; that seemed a point gained. "May I ask how it
occurred?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is all very commonplace! Your lordship had received a
threatening letter and called on the woman. She wanted money; you refused.
She already had a husband living in France, a ruined gambler of the Bourse,
but had tricked you into thinking she was your wife. You had discovered the
deception and discarded her. From a music-hall singer she had gone
down--down, until she, once beautiful, courted, had become a mere--what she
was, associate of one like Dandy Joe, cunning, unscrupulous. At your
refusal to become the victim of their blackmailing scheme, she in her anger
seized a weapon; during the struggle, it was accidentally discharged."</p>

<p>Was Lord Ronsdale asking himself how the other had learned this? If
Rogers had escaped <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340"
id="Page_340"></a>[pg 340]</span>with the paper, John Steele knew Ronsdale
might well wonder that the actual truth should have been discovered; he
would not, under those circumstances, even be aware of the existence of a
witness of the tragedy. But was Lord Ronsdale assuming a manner, meeting
subtlety with subtlety? John Steele went on quietly, studying his enemy
with close, attentive gaze.</p>

<p>"At sound of the shot, Joe, who had been waiting below in the kitchen
with the landlady, rushed up-stairs. You explained how it happened; were
willing enough to give money now to get away quietly without being dragged
into the affair. The dead woman's confederate, greedy for gain even at such
a moment, would have helped you; but there was a difficulty: would the
police accept the story of suicide? There were signs of a struggle. At that
instant some one entered the house, came stumbling up the stairs; it was
the--'Frisco Pet."</p>

<p>John Steele paused; his listener sat stiff, immovable. "Joe hurried you
out, toward a rear exit, but not before," leaning slightly toward Lord
Ronsdale, "an impression of your face, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[pg 341]</span>pale, drawn, had vaguely
stamped itself on the befuddled brain," bitterly, "of the fool-brute. You
lost no time in making your escape; little was said between you and Joe;
but he proved amenable to your suggestion; the way out of the difficulty
was found. He hated the Pet, who had once or twice handled him roughly for
abusing this poor creature. You gave Joe money to have the landlady's
testimony agree with his; she never got that money," meaningly, "but gave
the desired evidence. Joe had found out something."</p>

<p>Once more the speaker stopped; there remained a crucial test. If Lord
Ronsdale had the paper, what John Steele was about to say would cause him
no surprise; he would be prepared for it. The words fell sharply:</p>

<p>"The landlady's son, Tom Rogers, was at the time in the house, in hiding
from the police. He was concealed above in a small room or garret; through
a stove-pipe opening, disused, he looked down into the sitting-room below
and heard, saw all!"</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous, magical; <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[pg 342]</span>Lord Ronsdale sprang to
his feet; John Steele looked at him, at the wavering face, the uncertain
eyes. No doubt existed now in his mind; Gillett had not secured the paper,
or he would have given it to his patron when they were alone. That fact was
patent; the document was gone, irretrievably; there could be no hope of
recovering it. The bitter knowledge that it had really once existed would
not serve John Steele long. But with seeming resolution he went on: "I had
the story from his own lips," deliberately, "put in the form of an
affidavit, duly signed and witnessed."</p>

<p>"You did?" Lord Ronsdale stared at him a long time. "This is a
subterfuge."</p>

<p>"It is true."</p>

<p>"Where--is the paper?"</p>

<p>"Not in my pocket."</p>

<p>The other considered. "You mean it is in a safe place?"</p>

<p>"One would naturally take care of such a document."</p>

<p>"You did not have any such paper at Strathorn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[pg
343]</span>"No?" John Steele smiled but he did not feel like smiling. "Not
there certainly."</p>

<p>"I mean no such paper existed then, or you would have taken advantage of
it."</p>

<p>John Steele did not answer; he looked at the drawer. The affidavit was
not there; but something else was.</p>

<p>"You are resourceful, that is all."</p>

<p>Lord Ronsdale had now quite recovered himself; he sank back into his
chair. "You have, out of fancy, constructed a libelous theory; one that you
can not prove; one that you would be laughed at for advancing. A
cock-and-bull story about a witness who was not a witness; a paper that
doesn't exist, that never existed."</p>

<p>A sound at the door caused him to turn sharply; a knocking had passed
unheeded. The door opened, closed. Mr. Gillett, a troubled, perturbed look
on his face, stood now just within. "Your lordship!"</p>

<p>"Well?" the nobleman's manner was peremptory.</p>

<p>The police agent, however, came forward slowly. "I have here something
that one of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[pg
344]</span>our men has just turned over to me." John Steele started; but
neither of the others noticed. "He found it at the last place we were;
evidently it had been dropped by the fellow who was there and who fled at
our coming." As he spoke, he stepped nearer the desk, in his hand a
paper.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Lord Ronsdale demanded testily.</p>

<p>Mr. Gillett did not at once answer; he looked at John Steele; the latter
stood like a statue; only his eyes were turned toward the nobleman, to the
thin aristocratic hand yet resting on the edge of the drawer.</p>

<p>"If your lordship will glance at it?" said Mr. Gillett, proffering the
sheet.</p>

<p>The nobleman did so; his face changed; his eyes seemed unable to leave
the paper. Suddenly he gave a smothered explanation; tore the sheet once,
and started up, took a step toward the fire.</p>

<p>"Stop!" The voice was John Steele's; he stood now next to the
partly-opened drawer, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345"
id="Page_345"></a>[pg 345]</span>his hand that which had been concealed
there, something bright, shining. Lord Ronsdale wheeled, looked at the
weapon and into the eyes behind it. "Place those two bits of paper
there--on the edge of the desk!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[pg

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2XXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3><a name='A_CONDITION'></a>A CONDITION</h3>


<p>Lord Ronsdale hesitated; his thin jaws were set so that the bones of the
cheek showed; his eyes gleamed. When he did move it was as if blindly,
precipitately, to carry out his first impulse.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't!" What John Steele held vaguely included, in the radius of
its possibilities, Mr. Gillett. "Unless--"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare!" Lord Ronsdale trembled, but with impotent passion,
not fear. "It would be--"</p>

<p>"Self-defense! The paper would remain--full vindication. In fact the
paper already is mine. Whether I kill you or not is merely incidental. And
to tell you the truth I don't much care how you decide!"</p>

<p>Again Lord Ronsdale seemed almost to forget caution; almost, but not
quite; perhaps he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347"
id="Page_347"></a>[pg 347]</span>was deterred by the look on John Steele's
face, scornful, mocking, as half-inviting him to cast all prudence to the
winds. This bit of evidence that he had not calculated upon, it was hard to
give it up; but no other course remained. Besides, another, Gillett, knew
of its existence; Lord Ronsdale felt he could not depend on that person in
an emergency of this kind; the police agent's manner was not reassuring. He
seemed inclined to be more passive than aggressive; perhaps he had been
somewhat overcome by this unexpected revelation and the deep waters he who
boasted of an "eminently respectable and reputable agency" had unwittingly
drifted into; in climaxes of this character one's thoughts are likely to
center on self, to the exclusion of patron or employer, however noble. The
police agent looked at Ronsdale and waited to see what he would do.</p>

<p>The nobleman moved toward the desk; the paper fluttered from his cold
fingers; when once more John Steele buttoned his coat the affidavit had
again found lodgment in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[pg
348]</span>It seemed a tame, commonplace end; but it was the end; all three
men knew it. John Steele's burning glance swept from Lord Ronsdale to
Gillett; lingered with mute contemplation. What now remained to be done
should be easily, it seemed almost too easily, accomplished. He felt like
one lingering on the stage after the curtain had gone down; the varied
excitement, the fierce play of emotion was over; the actors hardly appeared
interesting.</p>

<p>What he said was for Lord Ronsdale alone; after Gillett had gone, he
laid down a condition. In certain respects it was a moment of triumph; but
he experienced no exultation, only a supreme weariness, an anxiety to be
done with the affair, to go. But the one point had first to be made,
emphasized; to be accepted by the other violently, quietly,
resignedly,--John Steele did not care what his attitude might be; what he
chiefly felt was that he did not wish to waste much time on him.</p>

<p>"And if I refuse to let you dictate in a purely private concern?" Lord
Ronsdale, white with passion, had answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[pg
349]</span>"The end will be the same for you. As matters stand, Sir Charles
no doubt thinks still that you would make a desirable <i>parti</i> for his
niece. His wife, Lady Wray, unquestionably shares that opinion. Their
combined influence might in time prevail, and Jocelyn Wray yield to their
united wishes. This misfortune," with cutting deadliness of tone, "it is
obvious must be averted. You will consent to withdraw all pretensions in
that direction, or you will force me to make public this paper. A full
exposition of the case I think would materially affect Sir Charles and Lady
Wray's attitude as to the desirability of an alliance between their family
and yours."</p>

<p>"And yourself? You forget," with a sneer, "how it would affect you!"</p>

<p>"Myself!" John Steele laughed. "You fool! Do you imagine I would
hesitate for that reason?"</p>

<p>The nobleman looked at him, at the glowing, contemptuous eyes.
"Hesitate? Perhaps not! You love her yourself, and--"</p>

<p>John Steele stepped toward him. "Stop, or--I <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[pg 350]</span>have once been almost on
the point of killing you to-night--don't--" he broke off. "The condition?
You consent or not?"</p>

<p>"And if I--? You would--?"</p>

<p>"Keep your cowardly secret? Yes!"</p>

<p>To this the other had replied; of necessity the scene had dragged along
a little farther; then John Steele found himself on the stairway, going
down.</p>

<p>It was over, this long, stubborn contest; he hardly heard or saw a cab
drive up and stop before the house as he went out to the street, was
scarcely conscious of some one leaving it, some one about to enter who
suddenly stopped at sight of him and exclaimed eagerly, warmly. He was not
surprised; with apathy he listened to the new-comer's words; rambling,
disconnected, about a letter that had intercepted him at Brighton and
brought him post-haste to London.</p>

<p>A letter? John Steele had entered the cab; he sank back; when had he
written a letter? Weeks ago; he looked at this face, familiar, far-off; the
fog was again rising around him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351"
id="Page_351"></a>[pg 351]</span>He could hardly see; he was glad he did
not have to stir; he seemed to breathe with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Where--are we going?"</p>

<p>"To Rosemary Villa."</p>

<p>"I--should prefer--my own chambers"--John Steele spoke with an
effort--"it is nearer--and I'm a bit done up. Besides, after a little rest,
there are--some business matters--to be attended to--that will need looking
after as soon as--"</p>

<p>His head fell forward; Captain Forsythe looked at him; called up loudly,
excitedly to the driver.</p>

<h2><a name='CHAPTER_2XXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3><a name='NEAR_THE_RIVER'></a>NEAR THE RIVER</h3>


<p>A dubious sort of day, one that seemed vainly trying to appear cheerful!
A day that threw out half-promises, that showed tentatively on the sky a
mottled blur where the sun should have been! On such a day, a month after
that night in Lord Ronsdale's rooms, Captain Forsythe, calling on John
Steele, found himself admitted to the sitting-room. While waiting for an
answer to his request to see Mr. Steele, he gazed disapprovingly around
him. The rooms were partly dismantled; a number of boxes littering the
place indicating preparations to move. Captain Forsythe surveyed these
cases, more or less filled; then he shook his head and lighted a cigar. But
as he smoked he seemed asking himself a question; he had not yet found the
answer when a footstep was heard and the subject of his ruminations entered
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[pg
353]</span>room. John Steele's face was paler than it had been; thinner,
like that of a man who had recently suffered some severe illness.</p>

<p>"Ah, Forsythe!" he said, with an assumption of cheeriness. "So good of
you!"</p>

<p>"That's all very well," was the answer. "But what about those?" With his
cigar he indicated vaguely the boxes.</p>

<p>"Those? Not yet all packed, are they? Lazy beggars, your London
servants, just before leaving you!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"See here!" Forsythe looked at him. "You're not well enough yet
to--"</p>

<p>"Never felt better!"</p>

<p>"No chance to get you to change your mind, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least!"</p>

<p>For a few moments Forsythe said nothing; then, "Weed?" he asked,
offering Steele a cigar.</p>

<p>"Don't believe I'll begin just yet a while."</p>

<p>"Oh!" significantly. "Quite fit, eh?" Forsythe's tone sounded, in the
least, scoffing; John Steele went to the window; stood with his back <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[pg 354]</span>to it.
A short time passed; the military man puffed more quickly. It seemed the
irony of fate, or friendship, that now that he was just beginning to get
better acquainted with Steele the latter should inconsistently determine to
leave London.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you when you're away?" began Captain Forsythe.
"Command me, if there is. Needn't say--"</p>

<p>"There's only one thing," John Steele looked at him; his voice was
steady, quiet. "And we've already spoken about that. You will let me know
if Ronsdale doesn't keep to the letter of the condition?"</p>

<p>"Very well." Captain Forsythe's expression changed slightly, but the
other did not appear to notice. "Although I don't imagine the contingency
will arise," he added vaguely, looking at his cigar rather than John
Steele.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I shall leave with you certified copies of all the
papers," said Steele in a short matter-of-fact tone. "These, together with
the one you furnished me, are absolutely conclusive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>[pg
355]</span>"The one I furnished you!" Captain Forsythe rested his chin on
the knob of his stick. "Odd about that, wasn't it?--that the day in the
library at Strathorn House, when I was about to tell you how I had better
success the second time I visited the landlady, we should have been
interrupted. And," looking at the other furtively, "by Jocelyn Wray!"
Steele did not answer. "If I had only seen the drift of your inquiries, had
detected more than a mere perfunctory interest! With the confession given
me on her death-bed by the landlady, that she had testified falsely to
protect her good-for-nothing son, and acknowledging that another whom she
did not know by name, but whom she described minutely, had entered the
house on the fatal night--with this confession in your hands, a world of
trouble might have been saved. As it is," he ended half-ruefully, "you have
found me most unlike the proverbial friend in need, who is--"</p>

<p>"A friend, indeed!" said John Steele, placing a hand on the other's
shoulder, while a smile, somewhat constrained, lighted his face for <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[pg 356]</span>a
moment. "Who at once rose to the occasion; hastened to London on the
receipt of a letter that was surely a test of friendship--"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that!" quickly. "Test of friendship, indeed!"
Captain Forsythe looked slightly embarrassed beneath the keen searching
eyes. "Don't think of it, or--Besides," brightening, "I had to come;
telegram from Miss Wray, don't you know."</p>

<p>"Miss Wray!" Steele's hand fell suddenly to his side; he looked with
abrupt, swift inquiry at the other.</p>

<p>Captain Forsythe bit his lips. "By Jove!--forgot--" he murmured. "Wasn't
to say anything about that."</p>

<p>"However, as you have--" John Steele regarded him steadily. "You
received a telegram from--"</p>

<p>"At the same time that your letter intercepted me at Brighton."</p>

<p>"Asking you to return to London?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. She--wanted to see me."</p>

<p>"About?" John Steele's eyes asked a question; the other nodded. "Of
course; not difficult <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357"
id="Page_357"></a>[pg 357]</span>to understand; her desire to hush up the
affair; her fear," with a short laugh, "lest the scandal become known. A
guest at Strathorn House had been--"</p>

<p>"I don't think it was for--"</p>

<p>"You found out," shortly, "that she, too, had learned--knew--"</p>

<p>"Yes; she made me aware of that at once when she came to see me with Sir
Charles. It was she sent your luggage--"</p>

<p>"Sir Charles? Then he, also?--"</p>

<p>"No. You--you need feel no apprehension on that score." A peculiar
expression came into the other's glance. "You see his niece told him it was
not her secret; asked him to help her, to trust her. Never was a man more
perplexed, but he kept the word he gave her on leaving for London, and
forebore to question her. Even when they drove through London in that
fog--"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I know--"</p>

<p>"You? How--?"</p>

<p>John Steele seemed not to hear. "She saw you that night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[pg
358]</span>"She did, alone in the garden of Rosemary Villa. Sir Charles
behaved splendidly. 'All right, my dear; some day you'll tell me, perhaps,'
he said to her. 'Meanwhile, I'll possess my soul in patience.' So while he
smoked in the cab, we talked it over." An instant he regarded John Steele
as if inviting him to look behind these mere words; but John Steele's
half-averted face appeared set, uncommunicative. Perhaps again he saw the
girl as he had last seen her at Strathorn House; her features, alive,
alight, with scorn and wounded pride.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said shortly. "And the upshot of it all was--"</p>

<p>"She suggested my going to Lord Ronsdale."</p>

<p>"To invoke his assistance, perhaps!" Steele once more laughed. "As an
old friend!" Captain Forsythe started to speak; the other went on: "Well,
we'll keep his secret, as long as he keeps his compact."</p>

<p>"But--"</p>

<p>"I promised. What does it matter? Sir <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>[pg 359]</span>Charles may be
disappointed at not being able to bring about--But for her sake--that is
the main consideration."</p>

<p>"And you, the question of your own innocence--to her?" Forsythe looked
at him narrowly, smiled slightly to himself.</p>

<p>"Is--inconsequential! The main point is--the 'Frisco Pet is dead.
Gillett won't speak; you won't; Lord Ronsdale can't. Another to whom I am
about to tell the story, will, I am sure, be equally silent."</p>

<p>"Another? You don't mean to say you are deliberately going to--" Captain
Forsythe frowned; a bell rang.</p>

<p>John Steele smiled. "Can you think of no one to whom I am bound to tell
the truth, the whole truth? Who extended me his hand in friendship, invited
me to his home? Of course it would be easier to go without speaking; it is
rather difficult to own that one has accepted a man's hospitality, stepped
beneath his roof and sat at his board, as--not to mince words--an impostor.
I could have delegated you--to tell <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>[pg 360]</span>him all; but that wouldn't
do. It is probably a part of the old, old debt; but I must meet him face to
face; so I have sent for--"</p>

<p>A servant opened the door of the library; Sir Charles Wray walked
in.</p>

<hr />

<p>Below, in the cab, Jocelyn waited; her pale face expressed restlessness;
her eyes, deep and shining, were bent on the river, fixed unseeingly on a
small boat that struggled, struggled almost in vain, against the current.
Then they lowered to something she held in her hand, a bit of crumpled
paper. It was John Steele's note to Sir Charles asking him to call; stating
nothing beyond a mere perfunctory request to that end, giving no reason for
his wish to see him.</p>

<p>Her eyes lingered on the message; beneath the bright golden hair, her
brows drew together. The handwriting was in the least unlike his, not quite
so bold and firm as that she remembered in one or two messages from him to
her--some time ago. But then he had been ill, Captain Forsythe had told
her, and was still, he thought, far from well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>[pg
361]</span>She made a movement; the little fingers crumpled the message;
then one of them thrust it within her glove. She continued to sit
motionless, how long? The small boat, with sail at the bow and plodding oar
at stern, at length drew out of sight; the paper made itself felt in her
warm palm. Why did not her uncle return? He had been gone some time now;
what--what could detain him?</p>

<p>"Can you drop in at my chambers for a few minutes?" John Steele had
written. "A few minutes;" the blue eyes shone with impatience. He was
leaving London, Captain Forsythe had informed her; and, she concluded, he
wanted to see her uncle before he left. But not her, no; she had driven
there, however, with Sir Charles, on some light pretext--for want of
something better to do--to be out in the air--</p>

<p>"I'll wait here in the cab," she had said to her uncle, when he had left
it before John Steele's dwelling. "At least," meeting the puzzled gaze that
had rested on her more than once lately, "I may, or may not wait. If I get
tired--if when you come back, you don't find me, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[pg 362]</span>just conclude,"
capriciously, "I have gone on some little errand of my own. Shopping,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"Jocelyn!" he had said, momentarily held by her eyes, her feverish
manner. "There is something wrong, isn't there? Hasn't the time come yet,
to tell?"</p>

<p>"Something wrong? What nonsense!" she had laughed.</p>

<p>She recalled these words now, found it intolerable to sit still.
Abruptly she rose and stepped from the cab.</p>

<p>"My uncle is gone a long while," she said to the man, up behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, miss; not so werry!" consulting a watch. "A matter of ten
minutes; no more."</p>

<p>No more! She half started to move away; looked toward the house. Brass
plates, variously disposed around the entrance and appearing nearly all
alike as to form and size, stared at her. One metal sign a shock-headed lad
was removing--"John Steele"--she read the plain, modest letters, the
inscription, "Barrister" beneath; she caught her breath slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[pg
363]</span>"He certainly is very long," she repeated mechanically.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go in and see wot's detaining of him?" vouchsafed the
cabby in amicable fashion as he regarded the hesitating, slender figure.
"That's wot my missus allus does, when she thinks the occasion--which I'll
not be mentioning--the proper one."</p>

<p>"Third floor to the right, miss!" said the boy, occupied in removing the
sign and stepping aside as he spoke, to allow her to pass. "If it's Mr.
Steele's office you're looking for! You'll see 'Barrister' in brass
letters, as I said to the old gentleman; I haven't got at them yet; to take
them down, I mean."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said irresolutely, and without intending to enter,
found herself within the hall. There a narrow stairway lay before her; he
pointed to it; with an excess of juvenile solicitude and politeness,
boyhood's involuntary tribute to youth and beauty in need of assistance, he
told her to go on, "straight up."</p>

<p>And she did, unreasoningly, mechanically; one flight, two flights! The
steps were well <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364"
id="Page_364"></a>[pg 364]</span>worn; how many people had walked up and
down here carrying burdens with them. Poor people, crime-laden people!
Before many doors, she saw other signs, "Barristers." And of that multitude
of clients, how many left these offices with heavy hearts! In that dim,
vague light of stairway and landings she seemed to feel, to see, a ghostly
procession, sad-eyed, weary. But Captain Forsythe had said that John Steele
had helped many, many. Her own heart seemed strangely inert, without life;
she stood suddenly still, as if asking herself why she was there.</p>

<p>Near his door! About to turn, to retrace her steps--an illogical
sequence to the illogical action that had preceded it, she was held to the
spot by the door suddenly opening; a man--a servant, broom in hand--who had
evidently been engaged in cleaning one of the chambers within, was stepping
out! In surprise he regarded her, this unusual type of visitor, simply yet
perfectly gowned. A lady, or a girl--patrician, aristocratic to her
finger-tips; very fair, striking to look upon! So different from most <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[pg 365]</span>of the
people who came hither to air their troubles, to seek assistance.</p>

<p>"You wished to see Mr. Steele?"</p>

<p>For an instant the servant's words and his direct, almost challenging
look held the girl. Usually self-contained as she was, she felt that
perhaps he had caught some fleeting expression in her eyes, when at his
abrupt appearance she had lifted them with a start from the brass letters.
The proud head nodded affirmatively to the inquiry.</p>

<p>"Well, you can be stepping into the library, miss," said the man. "Mr.
Steele is engaged just now; but--"</p>

<p>"That is just it," she said, straightening. "My uncle is with him, and I
wished to see--"</p>

<p>"If you will walk in," he said. "You can wait here."</p>

<p>Jocelyn on the instant found no reason for refusing; the door closed
behind her; she looked around. She stood in a library alone; beyond, in
another chamber, she heard voices--her uncle's, John Steele's.</p>

<h3><a name='PAST_AND_PRESENT'></a>PAST AND PRESENT</h3>


<p>And yet those tones were not exactly like John Steele's; they sounded
familiar, yet different. What made the difference? His recent illness? The
character of what he was saying, the fact that he represented himself, not
another, in this case? He was speaking quickly, clearly, tersely. Very
tersely, thought the girl; not, however, to spare himself; a covert ring of
self-scorn precluded that idea.</p>

<p>"Those boxes contained books; yours, Sir Charles!" were the first words
the girl caught.</p>

<p>"Mine! Bless my soul!" Her uncle's surprised voice broke in. "You don't
mean to tell me that all those volumes I had boxed for Australia and which
I thought lost on the <i>Lord Nelson</i> came ashore on your little coral
isle?"</p>

<p>Came ashore on his coral isle; the girl caught <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>[pg 367]</span>at the words. Of course he
had been saved, he who had saved her from the wild sea; she had realized
that after their last meeting at Strathorn House. But how? He had reached
an island, then--by what means? Some day her uncle would tell her; she
understood now why he had sent for Sir Charles, the motive that had
prompted him to an ordeal, not at all easy. She was glad; she would never
have told herself, and yet she could realize, divine, the poignant pain
this lifting of the curtain, this laying bare the past, must cost him. She,
too, seemed to feel a part of that pain; why? It was unaccountable.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said John Steele succinctly. "And never were angels in
disguise more foully welcomed!"</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" Sir Charles' amazed voice could only repeat. "I
remember most of those books well--a brave array; poets, philosophers,
lawmakers! Then that accounts for your--! It is like a fairy tale."</p>

<p>"A fairy tale!" Jocelyn Wray gazed around her; at books, books, on every
side. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>[pg
368]</span>She regarded the door leading out; was half-mindful to go; but
heard the man-servant in the hall--and lingered.</p>

<p>"Nothing so pleasant, I assure you," John Steele answered Sir Charles
shortly. Then with few words he painted a picture uncompromisingly; the
girl shrank back; perhaps she wished she had not come. This, truly, was no
fairy tale, but a wild, savage drama, primeval, the picture of a soul
battling with itself on the little lonely isle. She could see the hot,
angry sun, feel its scorching rays, hear the hissing of the waves. All the
man's strength for good, for ill, went into the story; the isle became as
the pit of Acheron; at first there were no stars overhead. The girl was
very pale; she could not have left now; she had never imagined anything
like this. She had looked into Greek books, seen pictures of men chained to
rocks and struggling against the anger of the gods--but they had appeared
the mere fantasies of mythology. The drama of the little coral isle seemed
to unfold a new and real vista of life into which she had unconsciously
strayed. She <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>[pg
369]</span>hardly breathed; her hand had leaped to her breast; she felt
alternately oppressed, thrilled. Her eyes were star-like; but like stars
behind mist. Strange! strange!</p>

<p>"When the man woke," he had said, "he cursed the sea for bringing him as
he thought nothing. One desire tormented him. It became intolerable. Day
after day he went down to the ocean, but the surf only leaped in derision.
For the thousandth time he cursed it, the isle to which he was bound. Weeks
passed, until, almost mad through the monotony of the long hours, one day
he inadvertently picked up a book. The brute convict could just read.
Where, how he ever learned, I forget. He began to pick out the words. After
that--"</p>

<p>"After that?" The girl had drawn closer; his language was plain,
matter-of-fact. The picture that he drew was without color; she, however,
saw through a medium of her own. The very landscape changed now, remained
no longer the terrible, barren environment. She seemed to hear the singing
of the birds, the softer murmur of the waves, the purring of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>[pg 370]</span>stream.
It was like a mask, one of those poetic interpolations that the olden poets
sometimes introduced in their tragedies. John Steele paused. Was it
over?--Almost; the coral isle became a study; there was not much more to
tell. Through the long months, the long years, the man had fought for
knowledge as he had always fought for anything; with all his strength,
passion, energy.</p>

<p>"Incredible! By Jove!" she heard Sir Charles' voice, awed and admiring.
"I told you, Steele, when you were about to begin, that we people of the
antipodes take a man for what he is, not for what he was. But I am glad to
have had your confidence and--and--tell me, how did you happen to light on
the law, for special study and preparation?"</p>

<p>"You forget that about half your superb library was law-books, Sir
Charles. A most comprehensive collection!"</p>

<p>"So they were! But you must have had wonderful aptitude."</p>

<p>"The law--the ramifications it creates for the many, the attendant
restraints for the individual--I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371"
id="Page_371"></a>[pg 371]</span>confess interested me. You can imagine a
personal reason or--an abstract one. From the lonely perspective of a tiny
coral isle, a system, or systems,--codes of conduct, or morals, built up
for the swarming millions, so to speak!--could not but possess fascination
for one to whom those millions had become only as the far-away shadows of a
dream. You will find a few of those books, minus fly-leaf and book-plate,
it shames me to say!--still in my library, and--"</p>

<p>"Bless you; you're welcome to them," hastily. "No wonder that day in my
library you spoke as you did about books. 'Gad! it's wonderful! But you say
at first you could hardly read? Your life, then, as a boy--pardon me; it's
not mere idle curiosity."</p>

<p>"As a boy!" John Steele repeated the words almost mechanically. "My
parents died when I was a child; they came of good stock--New England." He
uttered the last part of the sentence involuntarily; stopped. "I was bound
out, was beaten. I fought, ran away. In lumber camps, the drunken riffraff
cursed the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>[pg
372]</span>new scrub boy; on the Mississippi, the sailors and stevedores
kicked him because the mate kicked them. Everywhere it was the same; the
boy learned only one thing, to fight. Fight, or be beaten! On the plains,
in the mountains, before the fo'castle, it was the same. Fight, or--" he
broke off. "It was not a boyhood; it was a contention."</p>

<p>"I believe you." Sir Charles' accents were half-musing. "And if you will
pardon me, I'll stake a good deal that you fought straight." He paused.
"But to go back to your isle, your magic isle, if you please. You were
rescued, and then?"</p>

<p>"In a worldly sense, I prospered; in New Zealand, in Tasmania. Fate, as
if to atone for having delayed her favors, now lavished them freely; work
became easy; a mine or two that I was lucky enough to locate, yielded, and
continues to yield, unexpected returns. Without especially desiring riches,
I found myself more than well-to-do."</p>

<p>"And then having fairly, through your own efforts, won a place in the
world, having conquered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373"
id="Page_373"></a>[pg 373]</span>fortune, why did you return to England
knowing the risk, that some one of these fellows like Gillett, the police
agent, might--"</p>

<p>"Why," said John Steele, "because I wished to sift, to get to the very
bottom of this crime for which I was convicted. For all real
wrong-doing--resisting officers of the law--offenses against officialdom--I
had paid the penalty, in full, I believe. But this other matter--that was
different. It weighed on me through those years on the island and
afterward. A jury had convicted me wrongfully; but I had to prove it; to
satisfy myself, to find out beyond any shadow of a doubt, and--"</p>

<p>"He did." For the first time Captain Forsythe spoke. "Steele has in his
possession full proofs of his innocence and I have seen them; they go to
show that he suffered through the cowardice of a miserable cad, a titled
scoundrel who struck his hand from the gunwale of the boat when the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> went down, yes, you told that story in your fevered ramblings,
Steele."</p>

<p>"Forsythe!" the other's voice rang out <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>[pg 374]</span>warningly. "Didn't I tell
you the part he played was to be forgotten unless--"</p>

<p>"All right, have your way," grudgingly.</p>

<p>"A titled scoundrel! There was only one person of rank on the <i>Lord
Nelson</i> besides myself, and--Forsythe"--the old nobleman's voice called
out sharply--"you have said too much or too little."</p>

<p>John Steele made a gesture. "I have given my word not to--"</p>

<p>"But I haven't!" said Captain Forsythe. "The confession I procured, and
what I subsequently learned, led me directly to--Here is the tale, Sir
Charles."</p>

<hr />

<p>It was over at last; they were gone, Sir Charles and Captain Forsythe;
their hand-clasps still lingered in his. That was something, very much,
John Steele told himself; but, oddly, with no perceptible thrill of
satisfaction. Had he become dead to approval? What did he want? Or what had
been wanting? Sir Charles had been affable, gracious; eminently just in his
manner. But the old man's sensibilities had <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a>[pg 375]</span>been cruelly shocked;
Ronsdale, the son of his old friend, a miserable coward who, if the truth
were known, would be asked to resign from every club he belonged to! And
he, Sir Charles, had desired a closer bond between him and one he loved
well, his own niece!</p>

<p>Perhaps John Steele divined why the hearty old man's face had grown so
grave. Sir Charles might well experience shame for this retrogression of
one of his own class, the broken obligations of nobility; the traditions
shattered. But he thanked John Steele in an old-fashioned, courtly way for
what he had once done for his niece whose life he had saved. Perhaps it was
the reaction in himself; perhaps John Steele merely fancied a distance in
the other's very full and punctilious expression of personal indebtedness;
his courteous reiteration that he should feel honored by his presence at
any and all times at his house!</p>

<p>For a few moments now John Steele remained motionless, listening to
their departing footsteps; then turned and gazed around him.</p>

<p>Never had his rooms appeared more cheerless, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>[pg 376]</span>more barren, more empty.
No, not empty; they were filled with memories. Hardly pleasant ones;
recollections of struggles, contentions that had led him to--what? His
chambers seemed very still; the little street very silent. Time had been
when he had not felt its solitude; now he experienced only a sense of
irksomeness, isolation. The man squared his shoulders and looked out again
from the window toward that small bit of the river he could just discern.
Once he had gazed at it when its song seemed to be of the green banks and
flowers it had passed by; but that had been on a fairer occasion; at the
close of a joyous, spring day. How it came back to him; the solemn court of
justice, the beautiful face, an open doorway, with the sunshine golden
without and a figure that, ere passing into it, had turned to look back! It
was but for an instant, yet again his gaze seemed to leap to that luring
light, the passing gleam of her eyes, that had lingered--</p>

<p>That he saw now! or was it a dream? At the threshold near-by, some one
looked out; some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377"
id="Page_377"></a>[pg 377]</span>one as fair, fairer, if that could be,
whose cheeks wore the tint of the wild rose.</p>

<p>"Pardon me; I came up to see if my uncle--"</p>

<p>He stared at her, at the beautiful, tremulous lips, the sheen of her
hair--</p>

<p>"You!--"</p>

<p>"Yes." She raised a small, gloved hand and swept back a disordered
tress.</p>

<p>"Your--your uncle has just gone," he said.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"You do?" He knew it was no dream, that the fever had not returned, that
she really stood there. Yet it seemed inexplicable.</p>

<p>"I was in the library when they--went out. I had come up to see--I was
with my uncle in the cab--and wondered why he--"</p>

<p>She stopped; he took a quick step toward her. "You were in there, that
room, when--"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and threw back her head, as if to contradict a sudden
mistiness that seemed stupidly sweeping over her gaze. "Why did <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>[pg 378]</span>you not
tell me--you did not?--that you were innocent?"</p>

<p>"You were in there?" He did not seem to catch her words.
"Heard--heard--?"</p>

<p>A moment they stood looking at each other; suddenly she reached out her
hands to him. With a quick exclamation he caught and held them.</p>

<p>But in a moment he let them fall. What had he been about to say, to do,
with the fair face, the golden head, so near? He stepped back
quickly--madness! Had he not yet learned control? Had the lessons not been
severe enough? But he was master of himself now, could look at her coldly.
Fortunately she had not guessed, did not know he had almost--She stood near
the back of a chair, her face half-averted; perhaps she appeared slightly
paler, but he was not sure; it might be only the shadow of the thick golden
hair.</p>

<p>"You--are going away?" She was the first to speak. Her voice was, in the
least, uncertain.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," without looking at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>[pg
379]</span>"Where, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"To my own country."</p>

<p>"America."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is very large," irrelevantly. "I remember--of course, you are an
American; I--I have hardly realized it; we, we Australians are not so
unlike you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," irrelevantly on his part, "because your country, also,
is--"</p>

<p>"Big," said the girl. Her hands moved slightly. "Are--are you going to
remain there? In America, I mean?"</p>

<p>He expected to; John Steele spoke in a matter-of-fact tone; he could
trust himself now. The interview was just a short, perfunctory one; it
would soon be over; this he repeated to himself.</p>

<p>"But--your friends--here?" Her lips half-veiled a tremulous little
smile.</p>

<p>"My friends!" Something flashed in his voice, went, leaving him very
quiet. "I am afraid I have not made many while in London." Her eyes lifted
slightly, fell. "Call it the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380"
id="Page_380"></a>[pg 380]</span>homing instinct!" he went on with a laugh.
"The desire once more to become part and parcel of one's native land; to
become a factor, however small, in its activities."</p>

<p>"I don't think you--will be--a small factor," said the girl in a low
tone.</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear. "To take up the fight where I left it, when a
boy--"</p>

<p>"The fight!" The words had a far-away sound; perhaps she saw once more,
in fancy, an island, the island. Life was for strong people, striving
people. And he had fought and striven many times; hardest of all, with
himself. She stole a glance at his face; he was looking down; the silence
lengthened. He waited; she seemed to find nothing else to say. He too did
not speak; she found herself walking toward the door.</p>

<p>"Good-by." The scene seemed the replica of a scene somewhere else,
sometime before. Ah, in the garden, amid flowers, fragrance. There were no
flowers here--</p>

<p>"Good-by." He spoke in a low voice. "As I told Captain Forsythe,
you--you need not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381"
id="Page_381"></a>[pg 381]</span>feel concern about the story ever coming
out--"</p>

<p>"Concern? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Your telegram to Captain Forsythe, the fear that brought you to
London--"</p>

<p>"The--you thought that?"--swiftly.</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>The indignation in her eyes met the surprise in his.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said; "thank you for that estimate of me!"</p>

<p>"Miss Wray!" Contrition, doubt, amazement mingled in his tone.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said coldly.</p>

<p>And suddenly, as one sees through a rift in the clouds the clear light,
he understood.</p>

<hr />

<p>"You will go with me? You!"</p>

<p>"Why, as for that--"</p>

<p>Fleece of gold! Heaven of blue eyes! They were so near!</p>

<p>"And if I did, you who misinterpret motives, would think--"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>[pg
382]</span>"That I came here to--"</p>

<p>"I should like to think that."</p>

<p>"Well, I came," said the girl, "I don't know why! Unless the boy who was
taking down the signs had something to do with it!"</p>

<p>"The--?"</p>

<p>"He said to go 'straight up'!" she laughed.</p>

<p>He laughed, too; all the world seemed laughing. He hardly knew what he
said, how she answered; only that she was there, slender, beautiful, as the
springtime full of flowers; that a miracle had happened, was happening. The
mottled blur in the sky had become a spot of brightness; sunshine filled
the room; in a cage above, a tiny feathered creature began to chirp.</p>

<p>"And Sir Charles? Lady Wray?" He spoke quietly, but with wild pulsing of
temples, exultant fierce throbbing of heart; he held her from all the
world.</p>

<p>"They?" She was silent a moment; then looked up with a touch of her old,
bright imperiousness. "My uncle loves me, has never denied me anything, and
he will not in this--that is, if I tell him--"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a>[pg
383]</span>Did her lips answer; or was it only in her wilful, smiling eyes
that he read what he sought?</p>

<p>"Jocelyn!"</p>

<p>Above the little bird, with a red spot on its breast, bent its bead-like
eyes on them; but neither saw, noticed. Besides, it was only a successor to
the bird that had once been hers; that had flown like a flashing jewel from
her soul to his, in that place, seawashed, remote from the world.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
